It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two tourist buses have been destroyed by fire in a suspected arson attack in Belfast city centre.\",\n          \"An armed man who locked himself into a room at a psychiatric hospital in Istanbul has ended his threat to kill himself, Turkish media report.\",\n          \"Lewis Hamilton stormed to pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"40143035\",\n          \"38826984\",\n          \"35951548\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "['The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.\\nRepair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.\\nTrains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.\\nMany businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.\\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.\\nThe waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.\\nJeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.\\nHowever, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.\\n\"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we\\'re neglected or forgotten,\" she said.\\n\"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.\\n\"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?\"\\nMeanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.\\nPeebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.\\nScottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.\\nThe Labour Party\\'s deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.\\nHe said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.\\n\"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,\" he said.\\n\"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.\"\\nHe said it was important that \"immediate steps\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.\\nHave you been affected by flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or the Borders?

Email us on selkirk.news@bbc.co.uk or dumfries@bbc.co.uk.', 'A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.\\nAs they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.\\nOne of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\"', 'Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn\\'t\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari\\'s pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\\nVandoorne\\'s preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn\\'t. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India\\'s Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg\\'s Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\\nRed Bull\\'s Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India\\'s Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo\\'s team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team\\'s expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details', 'John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child.\\nThe 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989.\\nMr Bates denies all the charges.\\nGrace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.\\n\"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\" said Mrs Hale.\\nThe prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.\\nShe told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.\\nMrs Hale said: \"The complainant\\'s recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant\\'s car or in his cottage.\"\\nShe told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\\nMrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.\\nThe jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.\\nThe trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.', 'Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \"no hostage crises\", adding that the man was \"alone in the room\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\"His firearm was taken away,\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer\\'s possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year\\'s Eve which left 39 people dead.']\n"

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\\\" said Mrs Hale.\\nThe prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.\\nShe told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.\\nMrs Hale said: \\\"The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.\\\"\\nShe told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\\nMrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.\\nThe jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.\\nThe trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.\",\n          \"The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.\\nRepair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.\\nTrains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.\\nMany businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.\\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.\\nThe waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.\\nJeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.\\nHowever, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.\\n\\\"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.\\n\\\"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?\\\"\\nMeanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.\\nPeebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.\\nScottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.\\nThe Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.\\nHe said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.\\n\\\"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.\\\"\\nHe said it was important that \\\"immediate steps\\\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.\\nHave you been affected by flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or the Borders?

We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r1_fscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08991071902483942,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.22857142857142856,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.19512195121951217,\n          0.1,\n          0.22857142857142856\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r2_fscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rl_fscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.055105852352369714,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.14634146341463414,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.14634146341463414\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
