It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"summary\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Two tourist buses have been destroyed by fire in a suspected arson attack in Belfast city centre.\",\n          \"An armed man who locked himself into a room at a psychiatric hospital in Istanbul has ended his threat to kill himself, Turkish media report.\",\n          \"Lewis Hamilton stormed to pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"id\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"40143035\",\n          \"38826984\",\n          \"35951548\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "['The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.\\nRepair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.\\nTrains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.\\nMany businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.\\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.\\nThe waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.\\nJeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.\\nHowever, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.\\n\"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we\\'re neglected or forgotten,\" she said.\\n\"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.\\n\"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?\"\\nMeanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.\\nPeebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.\\nScottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.\\nThe Labour Party\\'s deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.\\nHe said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.\\n\"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,\" he said.\\n\"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.\"\\nHe said it was important that \"immediate steps\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.\\nHave you been affected by flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or the Borders?

Email us on selkirk.news@bbc.co.uk or dumfries@bbc.co.uk.', 'A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.\\nAs they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.\\nOne of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\"', 'Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \"did a good job and I didn\\'t\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari\\'s pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\"\\nVandoorne\\'s preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn\\'t. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\", adding: \"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India\\'s Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg\\'s Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \"optimistic\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\" Rosberg said. \"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\"\\nRed Bull\\'s Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India\\'s Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo\\'s team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team\\'s expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details', 'John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child.\\nThe 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989.\\nMr Bates denies all the charges.\\nGrace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.\\n\"The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\" said Mrs Hale.\\nThe prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.\\nShe told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.\\nMrs Hale said: \"The complainant\\'s recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant\\'s car or in his cottage.\"\\nShe told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\\nMrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.\\nThe jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.\\nThe trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.', 'Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \"no hostage crises\", adding that the man was \"alone in the room\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\"His firearm was taken away,\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer\\'s possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year\\'s Eve which left 39 people dead.']\n"

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,\\\" said Mrs Hale.\\nThe prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.\\nShe told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.\\nMrs Hale said: \\\"The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.\\\"\\nShe told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.\\nMrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.\\nThe jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.\\nThe trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.\",\n          \"The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.\\nRepair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.\\nTrains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.\\nMany businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.\\nFirst Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.\\nThe waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.\\nJeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.\\nHowever, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.\\n\\\"It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,\\\" she said.\\n\\\"That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.\\n\\\"Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?\\\"\\nMeanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.\\nPeebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.\\nScottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.\\nThe Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.\\nHe said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.\\n\\\"I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,\\\" he said.\\n\\\"Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.\\\"\\nHe said it was important that \\\"immediate steps\\\" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.\\nHave you been affected by flooding in Dumfries and Galloway or the Borders?

We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r1_fscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.08991071902483942,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.22857142857142856,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.19512195121951217,\n          0.1,\n          0.22857142857142856\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"r2_fscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.0,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.0,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"rl_fscore\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0.055105852352369714,\n        \"min\": 0.0,\n        \"max\": 0.14634146341463414,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5,\n        \"samples\": [\n          0.14634146341463414\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

            "[\"It's a great American martial arts movie. The fighting scenes were pretty impressive for American movie made in 90's. Of course the fighting scenes aren't that good as in Honk Kong movies, actually only few American movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in Honk Kong movies, even nowadays. When you watch American martial arts movie, you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes, but still having some nice moves, which can be surprisingly good sometimes, or at least that's what I'm expecting from these movies. I was impressed by this film. Some fighting scenes were really impressive, the acting, direction and the plot were good enough, so it's a really worth watching movie, if you like American martial arts films of the 90's.\"\n",
            " \"This is at least the third remake of this movie so if while watching it, there is a sense of deja vu, don't be surprised. All they did was change the setting of the story and tell it differently but the differences are not significant. And it doesn't get any better because the plot is flawed to begin with. It never works. And like its predecessors, the acting is mediocre.<br /><br />The plot has a unique ending which will surprise any one who has never seen the movie before but the ending doesn't fit the story. Had this movie ended ten minutes earlier, it would have worked and have been very satisfying and I would have thought it more worthwhile. But here is the spoiler and that in the end crime does pay because the criminal is not caught. I never like this message resulting from a movie.\"\n",

The insistent equation of Jews with disease is simply<br /><br />pathological, and even worse it almost becomes believable for brief seconds<br /><br />through its sheer repetition. The fact that something this crude works, even<br /><br />briefly, is an object lesson in itself. You have to have a strong stomach and a firm grip on yourself to sit through this, and I wouldn't recommend trying unless you have a good reason.\"\n",

One sad thing is that this could have made a decent feature length movie. Misty fits snuggly into her outfit and is a very cocky girl and when people are so infatuated with a game character, like Lara Croft, that they make nude calenders of her, you know that a soft-core flick is set to explode. Unfortunately, this is pretty pathetic. Especially the painfully fake sex scene between Darian and Misty, where you can see her hand is fingering air.

Karen Wallace (Grant) is the hysterical b!$3& who'll do anything to get attention from henpecked husband Martin (Christopher Lee) and, later, the rest of the people on board.<br /><br />Memorable Moments: Boeing 747 doing a belly flop in the Atlantic Ocean, Karen getting her chops busted when she goes too far, and furniture (and screaming people) who become 'ball bearings' in a sinking 'pinball machine.'<br /><br />The action and rescue sequences here are relatively phenomenal, but not much goes on in between. Hitchcock was supposed to have directed this sequel, but I forget the reason why not\\x85 He would've done wonders for the 1970 original, on which this sequel is partly inspired ('77 also got inspiration from `The Flight of the Phoenix'). <br /><br />Actors Cotten and de Havilland reunite from their days on `Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte' (apparently here they are not playing heavies, just reunited \\x91Autumn Years' lovers). And isn't the actress playing Emily's companion the same one who played the hammered-to-death maid on `Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?'<br /><br />TV actors include the girlfriend from `Mayberry RFD' (her character's daughter wins a drawing contest, or something lame like that), `Buck Rogers' Gil Gerard and `Dynasty's' Pamela Bellwood.<br /><br />\"\n",
            " 'Dumland focuses on the lives of one (American?) family... The father; a violent and obscene person who loves to fart and use profanity and who has no redeeming qualities. The mother; who appears to be a paranoid psychotic, never really says much. The son; an obscure annoying repetitive little fellow. The animation is simple and crude, but does suite the stories and the characters. The episodes were originally only available from the davidlynch.com website, but have now been released on DVD. There are 8 episodes on the DVD and a brief synopsis follows:<br /><br />1- The Neighbor: We meet the next door neighbor, and find out three things about him... he has a really nice shed, he only has one arm and he likes to do naughty things with ducks.<br /><br />2- The Treadmill: We find out that the wife has an affinity for exercise, but the husband doesn\\'t really think it\\'s a good idea. In the end, the exercise treadmill is victorious.<br /><br />3- The Doctor: The father has an unfortunate accident with an exposed live wire... the doctor\\'s examination is quite thorough (if not unconventional) but the diagnosis is \"you are perfectly normal\" (but we knew that).<br /><br />4- A Friend Visits: After an altercation with the new clothes hoist, a friend comes to visit (Believe it or not, he has one! but after we meet him we can understand why), no surprises when he tells us what his hobbies are.<br /><br />5- Get The Stick: We meet another neighbor, he has a stick stuck in his mouth (although we never find out how it got there). Unfortunately, removing the stick from his neighbor\\'s mouth ends up being harder (and more violent) than expected... but he is victorious in the end... Jesus some people can be ungrateful!!!<br /><br />6- My Teeth Are Bleeding: This was my favorite episode... and was also the most mind- numbingly repetitive and annoying (hmm, what does that say about me??). Not sure why the son\\'s teeth started bleeding, but believe me when I say it was minimal to the plot of the story. Which is an oxymoron, as the story had no plot. But did have a funny ending (involving a fly)!!<br /><br />7- Uncle Bob: After meeting Uncle Bob, and Uncle bob\\'s wife, we get a distinct feeling that the Dumbland gene-pool is very shallow. Uncle Bob is a sickly fellow (I shan\\'t elaborate, lest I spoil it for you). Uncle Bob\\'s wife definitely wears the pants in his family... and the father definitely ends up on the wrong side of her ample fist (and spends the rest of their visit cowering in a tree in the back yard).<br /><br />8- Ants: After the home gets infiltrated with ants, and a misbegotten attempt to bug-spray them goes awry... he ends up spraying himself in the face with the bug-spray and starts hallucinating. The ants put on a fabulous song and dance show... he goes berserk trying to kill them, winds up in a full body plaster... and lets just say, the ants get their vengeance in the end.<br /><br />As bad as these stories are, there is something that kept compelling me to watch them. They do give another insight into the mind of one of my favorite directors. David Lynch. Maybe they were an outlet for him, to get rid of some of his violent thoughts?? I did actually laugh out loud at many points within the episodes. Many aspects are absurdly funny!!'\n",
            " \"I think that Elisabeth Rohm, though she may try hard, is not very good at all. I guess it was because of budget that she may have been the only one they could get for that price. I mainly watched it for the performance of Myron Natwick, whose work I know very well.<br /><br />He was the most believable and without doubt the most compelling to watch. When he wasn't on the screen, the thing went dead. This was filmed in Vancouver. He gave me the creeps, but be assured that in real life he is a kind, funny compassionate man. He even said playing that role gave him the creeps.<br /><br />I'll watch anything with him in it, but Elisabeth Rohm - never again. She was as exciting as lint on Law and Order. Maybe a very nice person, but no actress.\"\n",
            " \"I read James Hawes book. It was pretty neat, not great, but entertaining enough. Without having read the book I wouldn't have had the slightest idea what was going on, and it was still a stretch with that knowledge.<br /><br />Literally every element of this film is abysmal in ways I do not have the capacity to describe. Half digested fish could have made a better film with matchsticks and dayglo lipstick.<br /><br />Never before or since as a film made me feel so angry. The Mattress sequels came closest, but even they never reached such depths of utterly putrid nauseating appallingness that this bilge did.<br /><br />Since wasting 90 minutes of my life witnessing this plague on human kind I am now unable to even look at any book by James Hawes without feeling angry. That is the depth of hatred I have for this piece of sh*t. No, that's unfair. Let me apologise to all fecal matter for comparing you to the otherworldly evil that is Rancid Aluminium.<br /><br />Plain and simply a cancer on the world of cinema.\"\n",
            " '\"Emma Woodhouse\" Gwyneth Paltrow (Shakespeare in Love, Duets) has nothing to do with herself but painting, going with her friends on her chariot up and down, saying hello to people in town, and trying to match make everybody she knows. I guess there were no movies, no television in those days, and the girls had nothing to do but gossip. I wish she had read a little more. I like Gwyneth, and think that she is a lovely young woman. She is talented, and in \"Emma\" one has the privilege to hear Gwyneth sing. I am looking forward to seeing \"Duets\", where she is suppose to sing. She is brave to speak British English with all those native Britons, including Emma Thompson\\'s sister, \"Miss Bates\" Sophie Thompson (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Dancing at Lughnasa). \"Mrs. Elton\" Juliet Stevenson (Truly, Madly Deeply) was considered one of the most promising actors in 1991. Gwyneth is part of the American movie royalty, being none other than the daughter of director Bruce Paltrow (St. Elsewhere) and Tony Award Winner Blythe Danner (The Myth of Fingerprints). She will hopefully be around for a real long time. Lucky us! I liked Emma and also recommend it. It is one of those old stories that are still accurate those days. Favorite scenes: Emma singing and playing the piano. I specially like it when she sings a duet. Favorite Quotes: Mr. Knightley\": Emma, you didn\\'t ask me to contribute a riddle.\" Emma: \"Your entire personality is a riddle, Mr. Knightley. I thought you overqualified.\" Miss Bates: \"It left us speechless, quite speechless I tell you, and we have not stopped talking of it since.\"'\n",
            " 'I am going to go out on a limb, and actually defend \"Shades of Grey\" as a good clip-show episode, which delved into the life and death struggle of Commander William Thomas Riker who was battling a terminally fatal disease.<br /><br />The scenes from the flashback sequences were implemented quite well with the mood Riker was in such as when he was reliving his romantic episodes such as \"11001001,\" \"Angel One,\" and \"Up the Long Ladder.\" Tragic moments were highlighted such as Tasha\\'s death in \"Skin of Evil,\" as well as elements of pulse-pounding danger in \"Heart of Glory,\" \"Conspiracy,\" and the aforementioned \"Skin of Evil.\" Riker also exhibited courage under fire by telling some humorous jokes such as \"An ancestor of mine was bitten by a rattlesnake once...after 3 days of intense pain, the snake died.\" This episode highlighted the psychological ordeal of Will Riker under extreme duress. And, YES, I am biased in my opinion in proclaiming \"Shades of Grey\" as a solid episode, because at the time of its original airing, my face was covered in sweat, wondering whether or not Riker would pullout of it alive and live to see other great, galactic, outerspace adventures beyond the final frontier...<br /><br />Of course, in subsequent years, I seem to have formed a singular opinion of this particular episode...but, if an award should go for \"the best clip-show episode in the history of television,\" then I believe that this episode should be highly regarded in that respect.']\n",
