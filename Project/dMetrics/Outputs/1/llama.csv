"Flooding in Newton Stewart, Hawick, and Peeblesshire, Scotland, has caused significant damage and disruption, with ongoing repair work and a flood alert in place.",Clean-up operations are continuing across the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway after flooding caused by Storm Frank.,"The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.
Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.
Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.
Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.
The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.
Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.
However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.
""It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,"" she said.
""That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.
""Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?""
Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.
Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.
Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.
The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.
He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.
""I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,"" he said.
""Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.""
He said it was important that ""immediate steps"" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

"A fire at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street, Northern Ireland, forced guests to evacuate, with two buses parked outside engulfed in flames.",Two tourist buses have been destroyed by fire in a suspected arson attack in Belfast city centre.,"A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.
As they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.
One of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.
The driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.
Both groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.
Police have appealed for information about the attack.
Insp David Gibson said: ""It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.
""While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.""",0.3,0.0,0.15,Llama
"Mercedes' Lewis Hamilton took pole position in Bahrain GP qualifying, followed by teammate Nico Rosberg and Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel.",Lewis Hamilton stormed to pole position at the Bahrain Grand Prix ahead of Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg.,"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.
Sebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.
The world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.
But stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said ""no clear instruction was given on where he should park"".
Belgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.
Vandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer ""did a good job and I didn't"".
Mercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.
After the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.
But Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.
Vettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.
The gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.
Vettel said: ""Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.""
Vandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.
The Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.
He also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.
Button was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.
The 24-year-old said: ""I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.
""Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.""
Button, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: ""Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.""
The controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.
FIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he ""felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance"", adding: ""We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.""
The system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.
But it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.
Only one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.
The teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.
Todt said he was ""optimistic"" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.
""We should listen to the people watching on TV,"" Rosberg said. ""If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.""
Red Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.
Ricciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.
German Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.

Former scout leader and police officer John Bates is on trial for sexual abuse charges.,"A former Lincolnshire Police officer carried out a series of sex attacks on boys, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court was told.","John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child.
The 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989.
Mr Bates denies all the charges.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.
""The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,"" said Mrs Hale.
The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.
She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.
Mrs Hale said: ""The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.""
She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.
Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.
The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.
The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.",0.21621621621621623,0.057142857142857134,0.21621621621621623,Llama
"Man threatening to shoot himself and others at Cerahpasa hospital in Istanbul, Turkey, prompts evacuation of patients and staff.","An armed man who locked himself into a room at a psychiatric hospital in Istanbul has ended his threat to kill himself, Turkish media report.","Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.
Officers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.
Earlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.
The chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been ""no hostage crises"", adding that the man was ""alone in the room"".
Dr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.
He said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.
""His firearm was taken away,"" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.
The incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.",0.3181818181818182,0.09523809523809525,0.2727272727272727,Llama
