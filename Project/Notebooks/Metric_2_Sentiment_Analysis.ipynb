            " 'Confounding melodrama taken from a William Gibson story, produced by John Houseman and directed by Vincente Minnelli! Richard Widmark heads up posh, upscale rural nervous asylum, where his loose wife battles with self-appointed queen bee Lillian Gish, and Widmark himself gets the straying eye for staff-newcomer Lauren Bacall, who is putting her life back together after the death of her husband and child. Facetious and muddled, set in an indiscriminate time and place, and with a \"David and Lisa\" love story hidden in the plush morass. Widmark and Bacall do have some good chemistry together, but this script gives them nothing to build on. For precisely an hour, most of the dialogue concerns what to do about the drapes hanging in the library (this thread isn\\'t used as symbolism, rather it\\'s a red herring in a non-mystery!). The picture hopes to show the loggerheads that disparate people come to when they\\'re working in the same profession and everyone thinks their opinion is right, but unfortunately the roundabout way Minnelli unravels this stew is neither informative, enlightening nor entertaining. ** from ****'\n",
            " 'I first heard about White Noise when I saw the TV advert. Before then I didn\\'t even know it existed. I watched the trailer online and decided that I would go and see it. Now being a fan of films like The Sixth Sense, I thought that this film would give me everything I wanted. It has Michael Keaton in it, and he rocks. Unfortunately the film did not deliver. It tried to be another Sixth Sense or Stir of Echoes, and failed miserably. It has a very promising start, but the middle just drags on repeating itself, and ends with a completely poor twist which any monkey could have figured out. Unfortunately like most \"Scary\" films nowadays it relies on loud noises and bangs to make the audience jump. This film could have been so much more. It\\'s a shame because it was a good idea.'\n",
            " 'Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous vaudeville comedy act, Lewis and Clark, who haven\\'t spoken in over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has held a grudge ever since. Such is the premise of this hilarious Neil Simon play made into a movie. Of course, what makes it so good is Matthau and Burns in their prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin shines as Matthau\\'s nephew and agent. There\\'s even old clips of actual stars of the golden era to get you into the groove of the film, and character actor Fritz Feld starts it all off with a \"pop.\" Rosetta LaNoire, who started out in the 30s in theater with Orson Welles and later was Grandma on \"Family Matters,\" is great in a small role.<br /><br />The only problem I had with it (and maybe I\\'m being too picky and/or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they first meet. Granted, he\\'s had a lot of resentment festering in all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or just plain bad manners taken out of context. Also, I\\'m used to seeing Matthau act that way in other movies, but not to George Burns. And, Matthau\\'s bellowing tends to get a little old. <br /><br />All in all, if you need a consistently funny film to help and forget your troubles, put in \"The Sunshine Boys.\" They\\'ll lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life.<br /><br />Benjamin: \"You have to slide it.\" <br /><br />Matthau: \"Wait, wait. I think you have to slide it.\"'\n",

            " 'Body Slam (1987) is a flat out terrible movie. The low budget reeks, the direction is pedestrian (at best) and the writing and acting is lame. But if you\\'re into old school wrestling (circa 1970\\'s through the mid-80\\') then you\\'ll be more entertained than the average viewer. I have to warn you, this movie stinks on ice. I gave it a two because I felt like being generous. This turkey was \"directed\" by stunt master Hal Needham. The stars are Roddy Piper, The Tonga Kid and a bunch of scrub wrestlers and c-list actors (Dirk Benedict).<br /><br />The synopsis of this \"movie\" is about a promoter who wants to combine \"hair rock\" and wrestling. But their are others that don\\'t want him to succeed. There\\'s more but I don\\'t want to SPOIL it for you. If you can stomach the bad acting and inane storyline, there\\'s a few surprises near the end for die-hard wrestling fans. <br /><br />I wouldn\\'t recommend this to my worse enemy (and I mean it).'\n",
            " \"While most of the movie is very amateurish, the Kosher slaughter scene is played up, but not untrue. Kosher law says that an animal must be conscious when the blade touches it's skin. The Kosher slaughter scene is accurate as anyone knows who has seen one, or has seen the Peta film showing a Kosher slaughter, in which the animals throat is cut, and the esophagus cut out while it is still alive, conscious, and obviously suffering. We must remember that history is written by the victors.
