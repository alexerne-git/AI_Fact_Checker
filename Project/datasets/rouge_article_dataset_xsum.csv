0,"The full cost of damage in Newton Stewart, one of the areas worst affected, is still being assessed.
Repair work is ongoing in Hawick and many roads in Peeblesshire remain badly affected by standing water.
Trains on the west coast mainline face disruption due to damage at the Lamington Viaduct.
Many businesses and householders were affected by flooding in Newton Stewart after the River Cree overflowed into the town.
First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the area to inspect the damage.
The waters breached a retaining wall, flooding many commercial properties on Victoria Street - the main shopping thoroughfare.
Jeanette Tate, who owns the Cinnamon Cafe which was badly affected, said she could not fault the multi-agency response once the flood hit.
However, she said more preventative work could have been carried out to ensure the retaining wall did not fail.
""It is difficult but I do think there is so much publicity for Dumfries and the Nith - and I totally appreciate that - but it is almost like we're neglected or forgotten,"" she said.
""That may not be true but it is perhaps my perspective over the last few days.
""Why were you not ready to help us a bit more when the warning and the alarm alerts had gone out?""
Meanwhile, a flood alert remains in place across the Borders because of the constant rain.
Peebles was badly hit by problems, sparking calls to introduce more defences in the area.
Scottish Borders Council has put a list on its website of the roads worst affected and drivers have been urged not to ignore closure signs.
The Labour Party's deputy Scottish leader Alex Rowley was in Hawick on Monday to see the situation first hand.
He said it was important to get the flood protection plan right but backed calls to speed up the process.
""I was quite taken aback by the amount of damage that has been done,"" he said.
""Obviously it is heart-breaking for people who have been forced out of their homes and the impact on businesses.""
He said it was important that ""immediate steps"" were taken to protect the areas most vulnerable and a clear timetable put in place for flood prevention plans.

3,"John Edward Bates, formerly of Spalding, Lincolnshire, but now living in London, faces a total of 22 charges, including two counts of indecency with a child.
The 67-year-old is accused of committing the offences between March 1972 and October 1989.
Mr Bates denies all the charges.
Grace Hale, prosecuting, told the jury that the allegations of sexual abuse were made by made by four male complainants and related to when Mr Bates was a scout leader in South Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire.
""The defendant says nothing of that sort happened between himself and all these individuals. He says they are all fabricating their accounts and telling lies,"" said Mrs Hale.
The prosecutor claimed Mr Bates invited one 15 year old to his home offering him the chance to look at cine films made at scout camps but then showed him pornographic films.
She told the jury that the boy was then sexually abused leaving him confused and frightened.
Mrs Hale said: ""The complainant's recollection is that on a number of occasions sexual acts would happen with the defendant either in the defendant's car or in his cottage.""
She told the jury a second boy was taken by Mr Bates for a weekend in London at the age of 13 or 14 and after visiting pubs he was later sexually abused.
Mrs Hale said two boys from the Spalding group had also made complaints of being sexually abused.
The jury has been told that Mr Bates was in the RAF before serving as a Lincolnshire Police officer between 1976 and 1983.
The trial, which is expected to last two weeks, continues.","A former Lincolnshire Police officer carried out a series of sex attacks on boys, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court was told.",36266422

Ten minutes before the crash the car was in London Road, Croydon, when a Volkswagen Passat collided with a tree.
Police want to trace Nathan Davis, 27, who they say has links to the Audi. The car was abandoned at the scene.
Ms Chango-Alverez died from multiple injuries, a post-mortem examination found.
No arrests have been made as yet, police said.
Ms Chango-Alverez was staying at her mother's home in Streatham High Road.
She was born in Ecuador and had lived in London for 13 years, BBC London reporter Gareth Furby said. At the time of the crash, she was on her way to work in a hotel.
The remains of the bus stop, which was extensively damaged in the crash, have been removed.
Flowers have been left at the site in tribute to the victim.
A statement from her brother Kevin Raul Chango-Alverez said: ""My family has had its heart torn out, at this Christmas time, we will never be the same again.
""On Friday night we were together as a family with Veronica meeting her newly born nephew and preparing for Christmas.
""I last saw her alive as she left to go to work on Saturday morning, but moments later I was holding her hand as she passed away in the street.""

7,"Belgian cyclist Demoitie died after a collision with a motorbike during Belgium's Gent-Wevelgem race.
The 25-year-old was hit by the motorbike after several riders came down in a crash as the race passed through northern France.
""The main issues come when cars or motorbikes have to pass the peloton and pass riders,"" Team Sky's Rowe said.
""That is the fundamental issue we're looking into.
""There's a lot of motorbikes in and around the race whether it be cameras for TV, photographers or police motorbikes.
""In total there's around 50 motorbikes that work on each race.
""We've got a riders union and we're coming together to think of a few ideas, whether we cap a speed limit on how fast they can overtake us.
""Say we put a 10 kilometres per hour limit on it, if we're going 50kph they're only allowed to pass us 60kph or something like that.""
Demoitie, who was riding for the Wanty-Gobert team, was taken to hospital in Lille but died later.
The sport's governing body, the UCI, said it would co-operate with all relevant authorities in an investigation into the incident.
The Professional Cyclists' Association (CPA) issued a statement asking what would be done to improve safety.
Despite Demoitie's death, attitudes to road racing will stay the same says Rowe, who has been competing in Three Days of De Panne race in Belgium.
""As soon as that element of fear slips into your mind and you start thinking of things that could happen, that's when you're doomed to fail,"" he told BBC Wales Sport.
""If you start thinking about crashes and the consequences and what could potentially happen then you're never going to be at the front of the peloton and you're never going to win any races.""

8,"Gundogan, 26, told BBC Sport he ""can see the finishing line"" after tearing cruciate knee ligaments in December, but will not rush his return.
The German missed the 2014 World Cup following back surgery that kept him out for a year, and sat out Euro 2016 because of a dislocated kneecap.
He said: ""It is heavy mentally to accept that.""
Gundogan will not be fit for the start of the Premier League season at Brighton on 12 August but said his recovery time is now being measured in ""weeks"" rather than months.
He told BBC Sport: ""It is really hard always to fall and fight your way back. You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick.
""The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.""
Gundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his £20m move from Borussia Dortmund.
He is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.
Manager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.
Gundogan said: ""Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.
""We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.""
City complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.
Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.
Spurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.
And Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.
He said: ""Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.
""They are really uncomfortable to play against.
""I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.""",Manchester City midfielder Ilkay Gundogan says it has been mentally tough to overcome a third major injury.,40758845
11,"Weaknesses in the way mice swapped data with computers left them vulnerable, said security firm Bastille Networks.
Attackers could spoof poorly protected signals letting them use PCs as if they were sitting in front of them, it said.
Information about the loopholes have been passed to the makers of vulnerable mice, some of who are creating updates to make the mice more secure.
The radio signals sent by many wireless mice to a ""dongle"" plugged in to a computer were often unencrypted, said Marc Newlin and Balint Seeber, from Bastille, who carried out the research.
""That makes it possible for the attacker to send unencrypted traffic to the dongle pretending to be a keyboard and have it result as keystrokes on your computer,"" Mr Newlin said.
By contrast, they said, signals sent by wireless keyboards were scrambled to stop attackers eavesdropping on or spoofing them.
The pair found they could spoof signals for mice using a few lines of code and an antenna and dongle that cost $20 (Â£15).
The attack worked at distances of up to 180m (590ft).
Using this kit, they sent specially crafted mouse clicks that a computer interpreted as key presses, letting them run commands and take control of a target machine.
The Bastille researchers said many companies spent a lot of time and money securing the physical devices sitting on their networks but often neglected to keep an eye on data sent via radio.
Wireless mice produced by HP, Lenovo, Amazon and Dell were found to be vulnerable.
Bastille said it had reported its findings to the hardware makers and to the company that made the chipset used inside the spoofable mice.
Updates to the internal computer code, or firmware, for some of the vulnerable mice are now being made available,
But Bastille said many of the insecure mice it had found could not be updated.","Hackers could gain access to home and corporate networks via security flaws in wireless mice, suggests research.",35890902
13,"The EC's doubts about the arrangement were detailed in a document on Friday.
The EC said that its ""preliminary view is that the tax ruling... by Luxembourg in favour of Amazon constitutes state aid.""
However, Amazon said it ""has received no special tax treatment from Luxembourg"".
""We are subject to the same tax laws as other companies operating here [in Luxembourg],"" it said.
The Luxembourg finance ministry said: ""Luxembourg is confident that the state aid allegations in this case are without merit and will be able to convince the Commission of the legitimacy of the anticipatory decision in question and that no competitive advantage was granted,"" it said.
The European Commission began a probe of the tax arrangement last year, saying that it had suspicions it broke EU rules.
The Commission document, which was sent to the Luxembourg Ministry of Foreign Affairs in October, gives its rationale for launching the investigation.
The Commission said it had ""no indication"" that the tax arrangement was ""compatible with the internal market"".
The current European Commission chief, Jean-Claude Juncker, was prime minister of Luxembourg when the deal was struck.
Mr Juncker has come under pressure over claims that around 340 global companies were granted tax  avoidance deals during his 18 year tenure in Luxembourg.
Commission doubts over the Amazon deal included whether Luxembourg had properly looked into Amazon's ""transfer pricing"" proposals about how money would be moved between different Amazon subsidiaries.
Doubts also existed about whether the country had assessed that the proposed tax regime was in line with market conditions before agreeing the deal in 2003, the European Commission document said.
The Commission also had questions about how royalty payments between certain Amazon companies were calculated, and whether ""Amazon has a financial incentive to exaggerate the amount of the royalty"" between its Luxembourg head office company and an Amazon firm that holds shares in the head office company.
""If the royalty is exaggerated, it would unduly reduce the tax paid by Amazon in Luxembourg by shifting profits to an untaxed entity from the perspective of corporate taxation,"" the EC said.
It added that Luxembourg might have been too hasty in assessing Amazon's requested arrangement before striking the deal.
Luxembourg's finance ministry said it ""has provided all the information required by the Commission and cooperated fully with the Commission in its investigation.""
""Among other things, detailed reports on the transfer price requested by the Commission were disclosed,"" it added.
Luxembourg is also being investigated by the Commission over suspected ""sweetheart"" tax deals with the financing arm of carmaker Fiat.
In addition, Ireland's tax deal with Apple and the Netherlands' arrangement with Starbucks are being scrutinised as part of a crackdown on multinationals' tax avoidance schemes.","The European Commission has disclosed a preliminary finding that Amazon's tax arrangements in Luxembourg probably constitute ""state aid"".",30844962

The Balmoral Show is run by the Royal Ulster Agricultural Society (RUAS) and dates back 148 years.
Last year, it attracted more than 90,000 visitors to its recently-adopted home outside Lisburn in County Antrim.
It was traditionally staged at the RUAS's headquarters in south Belfast, but the show moved to a larger venue on the site of the former Maze prison in 2013.
The Maze venue, re-named Balmoral Park, is now hosting the show for the fourth consecutive year.
The 2016 event coincides with Northern Ireland's Year of Food and Drink, and local produce features prominently in the exhibitions.
One of this year's highlights is an ""edible garden"", in which visitors can see their food growing in the ground before it gets to their plates.
The aim of the garden is to encourage people to grow their own food at home.
The event will also showcase the best of local livestock, with prized pigs, cattle, poultry and ponies all lining up in bid to be the stars of the show.
Their owners will also get a chance to shine, with horse riding and show jumping displays along with sheep shearing competitions and awards for the best livestock breeders and handlers.
For younger visitors, there is a family fun area hosting displays from the Northern Ireland School of Falconry as well as a gun dog skills demonstration and a performance from balloon artist Bruce Airhead.

15,"Mr Mosley wants Google to block photos of him at a sex party first printed in the now-defunct News of the World, which he successfully sued in 2008.
He is suing the internet firm for breaches of the Data Protection Act and misusing private information.
Google's barrister argued that Mr Mosley no longer has a ""reasonable expectation of privacy"".
Mr Mosley won damages from the News of the World after it published a story alleging he had organised a Nazi-themed orgy.
Photographs and a video which show his private sexual activity were originally obtained by News Group Newspapers Limited (NGN) in a clandestine ""sting"" operation.
Mr Mosley - the son of 1930s fascist leader Sir Oswald Mosley - won Â£60,000 after a judge ruled there was no substance to the allegation that there had been a Nazi theme to the sex party and found that his privacy had been breached.
In that ruling, the High Court also said the article was not in the public interest.
Mr Mosley has said the role-play at a rented Chelsea basement flat was harmless, consensual and private.
On launching his legal action last year, Mr Mosley urged: ""Google should operate within the law rather than according to rules it makes itself. It cannot be allowed to ignore judgements in our courts.""
Google has said it will remove URLs that it is alerted to, but is not prepared to remove the images entirely from its search engines.
In court on Wednesday, Google's barrister Antony White QC for Google conceded that it was technically possible to remove the images and was ""not burdensome"" to do so.
However, he argued that Google was not the publisher of the private information, and that Mr Mosley no longer had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the images.
On that basis, Google will seek to show that Mr Mosley's claim is unfounded.
The hearing is due to conclude on Thursday.",Google has asked the High Court to throw out legal action being taken by ex-Formula 1 boss Max Mosley.,30816523
19,"A State Department spokesman said the election process was flawed and could not be seen as free and fair.
He said the Ortega government had side-lined opposition candidates and limited monitoring of the polls.
Daniel Ortega won 72.5% of the vote with 99.8% of the ballots counted.
His closest rival, centre-right candidate Maximino Rodriguez, only received 14.2% of the vote.
The State Department's Mark Toner  said the Ortega government had not invited international election observers, which he said, ""further degraded the legitimacy of the election"".
""We continue to press the Nicaraguan government to uphold democratic practices, including press freedom and respect for universal human rights in Nicaragua,"" he added.
Mr Ortega had been widely expected to win both due to the popularity of his social programmes and because he faced no obvious political challenger.
A former left-wing rebel, Mr Ortega has led Nicaragua through a period of economic stability which has made him popular with the country's business sector and foreign investors.
Supporters of Mr Ortega took to the streets to celebrate his victory.
But even before the first results were announced, members of the opposition coalition Broad Front for Democracy (FAD) called the elections a ""farce"".
The FAD, which had urged voters to boycott the election, alleged that more than 70% had abstained from voting.
They were contradicted by the electoral authorities which put voter participation at 65.8%.
Mr Ortega's running mate was his wife, Rosario Murillo, who now looks set to become vice-president.
Analysts say that Ms Murillo already shares decision-making with Mr Ortega and could become president if her 70-year-old husband were to bow out.
Nicaragua's economy has grown at double the Latin American average, but the country still needs to attract more foreign investment.
A $50bn (£40bn) plan to build an interoceanic canal across Nicaragua with Chinese investment has gained international attention, but there are serious doubts over whether it will ever be built.

20,"The decision comes after 170,000 activists from around the world demanded action to help lesbians targeted for ""corrective rape"".
The authorities have been accused of not doing enough following the recent killing and rape of lesbian activist Noxolo Nogwaza.
Police say they do not consider sexual orientation when investigating murder.
""To us, murder is murder, whether somebody is Zulu, English, male or female - we don't see colour, we don't see gender,"" police ministry spokesman Zweli Mnisi told the BBC on Tuesday, after rights groups urged the police to do more to find those responsible Ms Nogwaza's death.
She was stoned, stabbed and gang-raped in the KwaThema township east of Johannesburg over the Easter weekend.
Unlike in many African countries, homosexual acts are legal in South Africa and discrimination based on sexual orientation is banned, but activists say gay and lesbian people are often attacked in townships.
They say ""corrective rape"" - when a lesbian is raped to either punish her, or ""correct"" her behaviour - is becoming increasingly common.
Ndumie Funda, founder of the gay rights organisation Luleki Sizwe which works in 10 black townships and rural areas near Cape Town, welcomed the government's announcement.
She said it was important to get ""corrective rape"" classified as a hate crime.
""The South African constitution is one of the highly respected and acknowledged constitutions and it says we are all equal; we're therefore reminding our government to say that this was being promised and we voted for you so we need protection,"" she told the BBC's Network Africa programme.
Luleki Sizwe started an online petition at Change.org to get the government to take action.
""In less than six months, a tiny group of township activists has mobilised more than 170,000 people from 163 countries and gotten the highest levels of government to address their basic demand, that the sadistic crime of 'corrective rape' be taken seriously,"" Change.org representative Benjamin Joffe-Walt is quoted by the Sapa news agency as saying.
Justice ministry spokesman Tlali Tlali said the the task team would begin its work in July and include six representatives from the judiciary, police and department of social development and six representatives from the gay community.
""The team will be charged with developing a legislative intervention plan, a public awareness strategy, and LGBTI [lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex]-sensitive shelters,"" he said.
In 2008, female footballer and gay rights activist Eudy Simelane was also killed in KwaThema, some 80km (50 miles) east of Johannesburg.

The German parliament approved the opening of negotiations on Friday.
The bailout could total €86bn (£60bn) in exchange for austerity measures.
In a damning assessment, Mr Varoufakis told the BBC's Mark Lobel: ""This programme is going to fail whoever undertakes its implementation.""
Asked how long that would take, he replied: ""It has failed already.""
Mr Varoufakis resigned earlier this month, in what was widely seen as a conciliatory gesture towards the eurozone finance ministers with whom he had clashed frequently.
He said Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has admitted that he does not believe in the bailout, had little option but to sign.
""We were given a choice between being executed and capitulating. And he decided that capitulation was the optimal strategy.""
Mr Tsipras has announced a cabinet reshuffle, sacking several ministers who voted against the reforms in parliament this week.
But he opted not to bring in technocrats or opposition politicians as replacements.
As a result, our correspondent says, Mr Tsipras will preside over ministers who, like himself, harbour serious doubts about the reform programme.
Greece must pass further reforms on Wednesday next week to secure the bailout.
Germany was the last of the eurozone countries needing parliamentary approval to begin the talks.
But the head of the group of eurozone finance ministers, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, has warned that the process will not be easy, saying he expected the negotiations to take four weeks.
On Saturday, the Greek government ordered banks to open on Monday following three weeks of closures.
But the decree stated that the weekly withdrawal limit should be a maximum €420.
Separately, the European Council approved the €7bn bridging loan for Greece from an EU-wide emergency fund. The loan was approved in principle by eurozone ministers on Thursday and now has the go-ahead from all non-euro states.

A decision on any ban will come in the week commencing 1 August.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) has opted against a blanket ban.
""I can assure you that our board will take the right decision in the interest of sport and the interest of the Paralympic movement moving forward,"" said Craven.
On Sunday, the IOC said it would leave it up to the governing bodies of individual sports to decide if Russian competitors are clean and should be allowed to take part.
But Craven, himself a member of the IOC, was critical of that decision and said the IPC would not necessarily follow suit.
""I am disappointed in their decision, but that is a personal view,"" he added.
""We have to acknowledge their right to take such a decision. This is ultra-serious. I don't think there has been a situation in the past where you have had institutional doping on such a scale.
""We believe the Russian NPC is either unwilling or unable to uphold the IPC anti-doping code, which is in line with the World Anti-Doping Agency code, so that is what they have to respond to.""
Canadian law professor Richard McLaren's report, published last week, claimed Russia operated a state-sponsored doping programme from 2011 to 2015.
The IPC said it acted after McLaren provided the names of the athletes associated with the 35 ""disappearing positive samples"" from the Moscow laboratory highlighted in the report.
Nineteen samples potentially doctored as part of the sample-swapping regime during the 2014 Sochi Paralympic Winter Games have been sent for further analysis.

Finance Minister Jane Hutt said it would help ""generate immediate benefits"" for the economy.
But Plaid Cymru said it was ""completely inadequate"" and the Conservatives said it should go to council tax payers.
Labour and the Lib Dems announced a budget deal on Friday night, ending weeks of negotiations between ministers and opposition parties.
With 30 of the assembly's 60 seats, Labour needs the help of at least one other party to approve its spending plans.
The £38.9m windfall - to be spent over two years - also formed part of budget discussions.
The money is coming down from the Treasury as a result of a council tax freeze in England.
A programme to help businesses hire young recruits is among projects receiving funding. The government said an extra £4.9m would create 1,800 more apprenticeships.
Some £9m will go towards upgrading school buildings, with the same amount spent on delivering an additional 130 homes.
The government will spend £3.5 improving roads in places where it is planning to create enterprise zones. Five parts of Wales have been earmarked as zones where businesses will get help to grow.
First Minister Carwyn Jones has said that copying the UK government by using the money to keep down council tax would not significantly benefit the economy, adding that tax bills for band D homes were lower on average in Wales.
Labour has faced criticism from opponents, particularly Plaid Cymru, for not doing enough to respond to a deteriorating economic situation.
Ms Hutt pointed to other government spending commitments, intended to help growth.
She said she had considered proposals to spend the money from across the government.
She said: ""This package builds on those actions to boost the economy and develop public services, generating immediate benefits for our economy while complementing our long term aims.""
Conservative shadow finance minister Paul Davies said he was disappointed ministers were using additional resources to ""top up"" existing policies.
He said: ""There is nothing new in this package other than a fresh attempt by Welsh Labour ministers to be seen to act on the economy, while spending money which would be better spent by taxpayers themselves.""
Welsh Lib Dem leader Kirsty Williams said her party will also work with the government on how to spend any money allocated to Wales as a result of Tuesday's Autumn Statement by Chancellor George Osborne.

Network Rail has closed all four lines between East Croydon and London Bridge, meaning Southern services to London Bridge are either cancelled or diverted.
London Overground services are not running between West Croydon/Crystal Palace and New Cross Gate.
Carl Leadbetter, Thames Water's regional network manager, said: ""Our teams continue to work as fast as possible on this critical job.
""While we need to work quickly to reopen the train lines, we also need to consider local residents, who will potentially suffer from sewer flooding if the pipe is not properly enclosed.
""This is an extremely complex job as the pipe is in a difficult location in the tracks and six metres below the ground.""
Network Rail apologised for the delays and said it was working ""as hard as possible"" to get the problem fixed by Wednesday morning's rush hour.
Spokesman Chris Denham said the hole ""couldn't be in a worse place"".
""This is a massive piece of railway,"" he told BBC Radio London. ""It's the equivalent of shutting the A2 out of London in the morning. It's absolutely huge.""
Some passengers expressed their frustration on social media, mentioning how the problem occurred on the hottest day of the year so far.
Elsewhere in London, high temperatures have been disrupting trains between the city and the West, with speeds being cut over fears of rails buckling.
Trains coming out of Paddington, Euston and Liverpool Street all saw severe disruption.
And Southern services heading to Brighton from Victoria were heavily disrupted following a track failure in the Gatwick area.
It comes as commuters have experienced months of cancellations and delays on Southern trains due to an RMT dispute.
New rail minister Paul Maynard will appear before the Commons Transport Select Committee on Wednesday to give evidence on the Department for Transport's role in the issue.

37,"Overflow pipes at the Burry Inlet near Llanelli are used to help stop flooding.
But the European Court of Justice ruled this broke clean water laws in a special conservation area.
The Welsh Government, Natural Resources Wales and Welsh Water said they were investing in improvements.
Though the UK has not been fined, it will have to pay legal costs in a case that also found a number of other breaches around the handling of waste water in England and Gibraltar.
The problems stem from the UK's ageing Victorian sewers, engineering marvels of their time, but now out of date.
The pipes were designed to mix both sewage and rainwater but over the years new housing developments and more frequent storms as a result of climate change have put pressure on the system.
Welsh Water has 3,000 special overflow pipes which act as relief valves to deal with the extra sewage and rainwater but go straight into rivers and the sea.
At the Burry Inlet there are 14 overflow pipes which discharge into an area supposed to be protected by UK and EU laws.
It includes salt marshes and is a habitat for tens of thousands of wild birds during the winter.
2,200
hectares of saltmarsh - largest continuous area in Wales
20,000 waterfowl are supported
13,590  oystercatchers
35,000  wildbirds spend winter including curlew, godwit and shelduck
The local cockling industry has also been hit but Welsh Water insisted this was not due to their discharges.
It is investing in a Â£113m project to reduce the number of spills.
RainScape involves reducing the amount of water that reaches the sewers through planting green spaces on streets and roofs to absorb rain and building channels to capture surface water.
The UK argued the improvements would mean it could comply with EU clean water laws by 2020.
However, the ECJ - which rules on disputes involving EU legislation - found the UK had acted ""too late"" and was failing in its obligations.
Judges ruled spills contributed to the deterioration of water quality in the Loughor Estuary.
A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We will continue to work with Natural Resources Wales and Dwr Cymru on a Â£113m programme to reduce the number of spills, improve water quality and reduce the risk of local flooding by 2020.""
Welsh Water added: ""We have met the legal permits for water quality in the Loughor estuary and are aware of ever increasing environmental standards and the need to manage long-term challenges, such as climate change, in a truly sustainable away.""
The UK Government said all sites in England included in the judgement ""now comply with the directive and plans are in place elsewhere across the UK to deliver compliance by 2020 at the latest"".",The UK has been found to be in breach of EU laws over the amount of sewage and waste water discharged into the sea off Carmarthenshire.,39805395

Cricket Scotland chairman Keith Oliver said: ""There is no doubt that the governing body of cricket in Scotland is unrecognisable from where we were in 2004.
""And the credit for this must go to Roddy and his staff.""
During Smith's time as chief executive, his management team have increased from eight to 25 and turnover has quadrupled.
I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels
Cricket Scotland reported a rise in participation figures for players, coaches and umpires during those 10 years.
And the national side have secured a place at next year's World Cup finals in Australia and New Zealand by beating Kenya in a qualifying event.
Oliver, who has worked with Smith during that whole period, said: ""Back then, we could not have imagined we would have won global qualifying events, played in world cups at youth and senior level, played One Day International games in front of thousands, run a fully professional national team as well as winning numerous development awards at a European and Global level.
""I and all at Cricket Scotland wish Roddy every success in his next role.""
Cricket Scotland will start the recruitment process to find Smith's successor with the aim of having a replacement in place early in the new year.
Smith said: ''I have thoroughly enjoyed my time with Cricket Scotland and it's hard to believe it has been nearly a decade.
""I am delighted that I leave an organisation in good health with a growing game and after a year of exceptional on-field performances by national teams at all levels.

The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has made it a scheduled monument on the advice of Historic England.
Kiwi soldiers played a significant role in the Battle of Messines, fought in June 1917 in Belgium.
Another monument at Cannock Chase in Staffordshire, marking the same battle, has also been granted protection.
The Terrain Model of Messines - a scale model of the battlefield - was made by German prisoners of war using soil, concrete, bricks and pebbles.
The model was a popular tourist attraction at the end of the war, but it became neglected and was lost until it was recently excavated.
It has now been covered over again to protect it from damage and erosion.
Roger Bowdler from Historic England said: ""These two monuments pay tribute to the bravery of New Zealand's fighting forces in the First World War and we are delighted that they are now being protected for the future.
""The Bulford Kiwi was cut into the chalk at the end of the war by Kiwi soldiers themselves, to mark the presence of their forces in England, and their achievements at the front.
""The taking of the Messines ridge was one of the war's most stirring attacks, and this model lay-out remains as testimony to the planning which made possible the victory.
""Like so much of our historic environment, these lasting reminders enable us to connect with lives and events from the past that made us who we are as a nation.
""One hundred years on, it is right to remember New Zealand's valour.""
Sir Jerry Mateparae, New Zealand High Commissioner to the UK said: ""It's fantastic to see Historic England protecting two very significant sites of huge importance for New Zealand.

47,"Figures show that for those aged 65, men can expect to live for another 19 years and women a further 21 years.
But there is concern that too many elderly people are living in poor health.
And the figures vary across the country, with the North East and North West having lower life expectancies for 65-year-olds than other regions.
Life expectancy among older age groups in England rose to its highest level in 2014 - with male life expectancy increasing by 0.3 years at age 65 and 0.2 years at ages 75, 85 and 95 since 2013.
Female life expectancy increased by the same amounts at the same ages.
This comes after a fall in life expectancy in some older age groups between 2011 and 2012.
The only region where male and female life expectancy did not increase in 2014 was in the North East, where male life expectancy was higher in 2013.
Among local authorities in England, the majority showed an increase or no change in life expectancy at age 65 - but one quarter showed a decrease.
In the past, statistics have tended to focus on life expectancy at birth but now that most deaths in England occur in people over the age of 80, patterns of mortality in older age groups are becoming more important.
Prof John Newton, chief knowledge officer at Public Health England, said the report presented a positive national picture that made achieving ""a good quality of life in later years even more important"".
""This report is an opportunity to remind people that, even during mid-life, it is not too late to improve your health,"" he said.
""Most of us could make changes today, like stopping smoking, being more active or eating better, that would allow us to look forward to healthier later years.""
He said it was not clear what had caused the variation in trends between local areas.
Danny Dorling, professor of human geography at the University of Oxford, said there was an urgent need to find out why improvements had stalled in many parts of England in recent years.
""Beneath the headline figures of this report, there is evidence of worsening health for many older people in some parts of the country,"" he said.
In Scotland, life expectancy continued to improve, with 65-year-old men expected to live for a further 17.4 years and women a further 19.7 years, according to the latest statistics.

52,"Glasgow City Council said it planned to put up the tax by 3% after the national council tax freeze ended this year.
Council leader Frank McAveety said while the increase would raise more than £7m, the council faced a budget gap of £67m.
Most councils have yet to confirm plans, with about a third indicating they may propose a 3% increase.
Further details of Glasgow's budget proposals are expected later.
Mr McAveety said: ""Raising Council Tax will support frontline services while protecting the most vulnerable in our city.
""One-in-four households will not pay a penny more - and we can avoid around £7m of the most difficult cuts, which would otherwise hit every community across the city.""
The average bill in the city - in the Band D category - is £1,213, compared to the national average of £1,149. All other bills are a set proportion of this figure.
But changes this year mean those in bands E, F, G and H properties will automatically pay more - even before the 3% across-the-board rise is factored in.
Increases are due to take effect just weeks before May's council elections.
BBC Scotland's local government correspondent Jamie McIvor said: ""Inevitably, close attention will be paid to decisions taken by councils in the west of Scotland where the SNP is hoping to make big inroads into Labour's council powerbase.
""Privately, some Labour councillors believe they are caught between a rock and a hard place.
""They argue a rise in council tax would merely limit cuts rather than end them, so they would risk asking voters to 'pay more and get less'.
""However, they also believe that if they did not raise the council tax, they would be accused of failing to use the means at their disposal to at least attempt to mitigate cuts.""
Labour-run South Lanarkshire has said it plans to freeze bills this year but the leader of West Dunbartonshire Council has indicated a rise is likely.
There have been no public declarations yet from Labour-run Inverclyde, Renfrewshire, East Renfrewshire, North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire and North Lanarkshire.

He insists he was the rightful winner of the polls, but Uganda's top court upheld the official result.
""We have been informed by police today that Besigye appeared in court in Moroto and was charged with treason,"" said his lawyer Erias Lukwago.
Mr Besigye was arrested on Wednesday in downtown Kampala and flown to Moroto, where he has been in custody ever since.
It follows a series of arrests of the opposition leader during the election campaign.
Meanwhile, Mr Museveni was sworn in on Thursday for his fifth elective term, extending his 30-year rule of Uganda.
Foreign observers said the poll had been marred by fear and intimidation.
In a BBC interview, Mr Museveni rejected allegations of vote rigging, and accused Mr Besigye of planning to incite violence.
Responding to criticism from European Union observers that the electoral commission ""lacked independence and transparency"", Mr Museveni told the BBC's Zuhura Yunus that ""those Europeans are not serious"".
""Transparency is what we've been voting for,"" he added.

Mr Platini has provided information to the investigation but said he did so as a witness.
Both men deny any wrongdoing.
Mr Platini has said he is still determined to run for Fifa president once Mr Blatter steps down.
Asked whether criminal proceedings had been opened against him, Mr Platini said: ""Absolutely not. I was heard last week by the Swiss Authorities only as a person providing information and I cooperated fully.""
But this was contradicted by the Swiss attorney general, Michael Lauber, who said: ""We didn't interview Mr Platini as a witness, that's not true. We investigated against him in between as a witness and an accused person.""
Mr Lauber also said he was prepared to search the Uefa headquarters as part of the investigation.
The allegations centre on a payment made to Mr Platini in 2011 at Fifa's expense for work he completed almost a decade earlier.
It came just two months before Uefa gave its backing to Blatter's 2011 presidential campaign, leading some to question the timing of it.
Mr Platini said he was told when starting the work that Fifa would not be able to pay him all the money because of its ""financial situation"".
But Fifa accounts show a revenue surplus of around $83m (Â£55m) from 1999-2002, when Mr Platini undertook the work as a technical adviser.
Fifa was thrown into turmoil this year when the US and Swiss authorities launched separate investigations into corruption at the body.

The world number six will now face the winner of Stephen Maguire's match against Barry Hawkins for a place in Sunday's final.
""I believe I can [win], and that's a great feeling to have,"" Higgins said.
""I was close last year, Alan [McManus] pipped me [in the quarter-final],"" he added.

""I don't know if that's because I feel as if I'm playing OK. At this event, you need to have a few sessions when you have good, frame-winning breaks. I did that against Mark Allen and in the second session against Kyren.
""To win this event you need a couple of sessions when you're dominating the other player. I feel as if my game can be there to do that but I'm sure other players will say the same thing.
""There are some sessions, especially this year, when I couldn't have played any better. I played [Ronnie] O'Sullivan in the final of the Champions and couldn't have played any better. You've just got to hope that comes out in the big matches.""
Maguire was once tipped as a potential world champion by O'Sullivan, and Hawkins said the Scot is benefitting from curbing his socialising at tournaments.
Higgins would like to face his compatriot Maguire in the semi-final, because it would guarantee that a Scot will feature in Sunday's final.

Rashad Charjuan Owens has been in jail on murder charges since March after four people died when his car broke through a barrier at the music, film and interactive festival.
The crash, which happened outside the Mohawk venue, also injured 23 people.
Among several wrongful deaths lawsuits was one from the family of Steven Craenmehr, a Dutch music executive, who was knocked off his bike.
His widow and mother claim that SXSW organisers didn't put enough traffic safeguards on the roads for pedestrians during the event, which sees thousands of bands performing at venues across Austin.
""A festival organiser or traffic design consultant of ordinary intelligence would have anticipated the danger,"" the lawsuit says.
Lawyers for SXSW released a statement which read: ""What happened on Red River was a terrible tragedy, caused by Rashad Owen's utter disregard of human life.
""Our hearts continue to ache for those injured and the families of those who lost their lives.
""We look forward to his prosecution for his awful crimes.""
Authorities say that Owens drove his grey Honda Civic through a barricade after an officer on a drink-drive patrol tried stopping the car.
According to police, his blood alcohol level was .114, above Texas' legal driving limit of .08.
In September, a SXSW safety report found that alcohol consumption and overcrowded venues during the event had left Austin facing a ""critical point where public safety could be compromised"" if changes are not made.

67,"His departure was said to be one recommendation of a report  by former US Attorney-General Eric Holder about the company's culture and practices.
Uber said the board had voted unanimously to adopt all the report's recommendations.
However, its contents will not be released until Tuesday.
Mr Holder was asked to undertake the review in February after former Uber engineer Susan Fowler made claims of sexual harassment.
The Financial Times reported that neither Uber nor Mr Michael would comment on whether he had resigned or been fired.
James Cakmak, an analyst at Monness Crespi Hardt, said Mr Michael's departure reflected Uber's need for a ""fall guy"" and could help protect Mr Kalanick.
""If Kalanick did leave, we think it would be very difficult for him to come back,"" Mr Cakmak told Bloomberg.
It is possible Mr Kalanick could be forced to take a leave of absence or have his role altered. That issue was on the agenda at a seven-hour board meeting held in Los Angeles on Sunday.
Mr Kalanick has been on bereavement leave following the death of his mother in a boating accident.
An Uber insider said the recommendations in Mr Holder's report include introducing more control on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Mr Kalanick have had an unusual degree of autonomy for a company of Uber's size.
The San Francisco-based ride-hailing service has more than 12,000 employees.
Mr Kalanick has earned a reputation as an abrasive leader and was criticised earlier this year after being caught on video berating an Uber driver.
He said in response to the video: ""I must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up.""
Uber board member Arianna Huffington has said Mr Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a ""scrappy entrepreneur"" to be more like a ""leader of a major global company"".
One Uber investor said the board's decisions were a step in the right direction, giving the firm an ""opportunity to reboot"".
Jan Dawson, an analyst with Jackdaw Research, said: ""This week we finally learn just how committed Travis Kalanick and the rest of the senior leadership team at Uber is  to meaningful cultural change.""
Last week Uber said it fired 20 staff after another law firm examined more than 200 cases including complaints about sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying.
As part of its attempt to draw a line under its recent problems, Uber said it had appointed Wan Ling Martello, a Nestle executive and Alibaba board member, as an independent director.
She is the third high-profile female appointment to the company in the past week.
Uber, which is still privately owned with voting control resting with Mr Kalanick and his two board allies, is valued at about $68bn.

Predictably, the main opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been quick to demand Qasab's swift execution ""as those who wage war against the country and kill innocents deserve no mercy"".
Qasab can still appeal to the highest court to review the verdict; and his last hope lies with a plea for clemency to the president.
His appalling crime of gunning down innocents surely qualifies as a ""rarest of the rare crime"", a condition for handing out the death penalty in India.
But, as critics of capital punishment say, there's no evidence to show that the death penalty deters crime.
Two-thirds of the world's countries have done away with the death penalty in law or in practice. Last year, according to Amnesty International, death sentences were imposed in 63 countries, but only 21 countries actually carried out executions.
India has shied away from executing people for many years now.
There have been only two hangings in the country in the past 12 years and the majority of convicts on death row can expect their sentences to be commuted to life. Former president Pratibha Patil commuted the death sentences of 35 convicts midway through her five-year term.
Clemency pleas of 29 prisoners on death row in India are pending before the president. They include Afzal Guru, who was convicted for carrying out an attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001. The Supreme Court upheld his death sentence as long ago as 2004.
Then there is a serious practical problem: there are only one or two hangmen available in India. Two years ago, I met one in a Calcutta prison who had been employed as a hangman-cum-sweeper, and was still waiting to carry out his first execution.
Recently, 14 retired Indian judges wrote to the president asking him to commute the death sentences of 13 inmates being held in prisons across the country. And the Supreme Court itself recently admitted that some death penalties it had upheld were erroneous.
""Public opinion in India can no longer ignore the global movement in favour of abolition of the death penalty,"" says AP Shah, the former chief justice of the Delhi High Court in an interview in today's The Times of India.

73,"An operation to pump 3,000 tonnes of water out of the Hoegh Osaka is expected to last until Sunday.
But poor weather conditions has made it unsafe for the salvors to board on Saturday to finalise pumping arrangements.
High winds of up to 83mph during the night caused the vessel to drag anchor for approximately 100 metres.
The ship had been anchored to help control its movement.
Salvage company Svitzer described working conditions on board as ""difficult"".
The Hoegh Osaka has been secured two miles (3.2km) east of the Bramble Bank sandbank from which it freed itself on Wednesday.
Water, described as being ""lightly contaminated with oil"" is being pumped from the ship's hold, which salvers say will cause the ship's 50-degree list to decrease.
The film of oil on the water is believed to have come from vehicles held within the hold.
With no power from the ship's generators, the water is being discharged using portable pumps during daylight hours.
The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said there was no evidence of any pollution.
Divers are also waiting until conditions improve to complete an inspection of the hull which began yesterday.
The Queen's Harbour Master has introduced an exclusion zone of 984ft (300m) around the vessel, currently held by tugs between Cowes and Lee-on-Solent.
Speaking at a press conference on Thursday, Hugh Shaw, the Secretary of State's representative for maritime salvage and intervention, said: ""I've got confidence the salvors can discharge the bulk of the water from sucking underneath the oil and that will leave us with a small quantity of oil on board the vessel.""
The 51,000-tonne vehicle transporter ""refloated"" itself unexpectedly at 14:00 GMT on Wednesday due to the high tide.
It was towed two miles east of Bramble Bank, where it was grounded on Saturday.
At a news conference on Tuesday, Bram Sperling of Svitzer, said there was some water inside because of a ""small opening in the vessel"" that had since been closed.
A refloat was the preferred option to avoid further damage to the ship from the sandbank.
Salvage experts boarded the ship on Monday and began carrying out an assessment to form a rescue plan.
The Singapore-registered transporter set sail for Germany at about 20:20 on Saturday, shortly before being deliberately run aground by the crew after it unexpectedly started to list.
There were 1,400 cars on board, including 1,200 Jaguar and Land Rover vehicles and 65 Minis, as well as 105 JCB machines and 500 tonnes of fuel.

87,"This follows earlier warnings that the reef was experiencing its worst coral bleaching event on record.
Prof Terry Hughes from the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce told the BBC the link between bleaching and global warming was ""very well established"".
Rising water temperatures cause corals to drive out colour-giving algae.
The corals can die if conditions do not return to normal.
In pictures: Great Barrier Reef
Vinegar could help save Barrier Reef
The taskforce's survey shows that the extent of the damage is most severe in the northern section of the 2,300km (1,429 mile)-long reef, which lies off the coast of Queensland state.
Only 7% of the reef showed no signs of bleaching, Prof Hughes said.
The effects of El Nino, as well as climate change, are being blamed for the rise in sea temperatures that causes the bleaching.
More than 900 individual reefs were surveyed using a light plane and a helicopter, with the accuracy of the aerial survey then checked by teams of scuba divers.
""I'm inherently an optimist, but I think we have a rapidly narrowing window of opportunity to save the Great Barrier Reef,"" Prof Hughes said.
""If we don't take action on global warming it will become more degraded.
""After three bleaching events the mix of coral species has already changed.""
This bleaching event is far more severe than previous bleaching events recorded in 2002 and 1998, he said.
""We know that this time only 7% of the reef didn't bleach. It was closer to 40% in the other two events.
""If these events start coming as frequently as every five to 10 years there will not be sufficient coral regeneration,"" he said.
Tourism to the Great Barrier Reef generates $A5bn ($3.9b, Â£2.7bn) each year and employs around 70,000 people, the National Coral Bleaching Taskforce said.
""Thankfully many parts of the reef are still in excellent shape,"" said Daniel Gschwind, chief executive of the Queensland Tourism Industry Council in a statement.
""But we can't just ignore coral bleaching and hope for a swift recovery.""

Mr Salmond cited ""considerable public concern"" over the Â£776m project, which he said had disrupted homes and businesses in Edinburgh.
The problems included a dispute between the city council and its contractor.
The first minister stopped short of announcing a full public inquiry, raising concerns over the timescale, and instead decided on a ""non-statutory"" option.
Speaking during first minister's questions in the Scottish Parliament, Mr Salmond said: ""I am sure that everyone in Edinburgh, and indeed all over Scotland, will be delighted to see that the Edinburgh trams are fully operational and carrying passengers.
""We cannot, however, lose sight of the considerable public concern over the conduct of the project, the disruption it has caused to households and businesses in the city of Edinburgh.
""I therefore recommended to the Cabinet, and it has been decided, to establish a judge-led public inquiry into the Edinburgh trams project to establish why the project occurred significant overruns in terms of cost and timing, requiring in particular a considerable reduction in the original scope.""
He added that the government had been assured by the City of Edinburgh Council that it would fully cooperate with the inquiry.
The first minister added: ""There are lessons to be learned from the conduct of the Edinburgh trams project and I think the course of action we are proposing will be a substantial assistance in doing that.""
Mr Salmond was responding to a question from Marco Biagi, the SNP MSP for Edinburgh Central and an opponent of the city's trams, which run on an 8.7-mile route, from the New Town to Edinburgh Airport.
""All of us who opposed the trams project from the start as risky and over-engineered have been disappointed almost daily by being shown to be right,"" said Mr Biagi.
""Now that the trams are indeed rolling, if there is to be any faith from the public in future management or potential cost estimates for projects like this, we need to know for sure that these mistakes will never be repeated"".
In the decade since the first money was allocated to the project, the price has doubled, the tram network has halved and it has taken twice as long to build as originally planned.

It prompted complaints that the signs were spoiling a conservation area.
The council said it used railings as much as possible to minimise posts in the pavement.
It said it ""met regularly"" with English Heritage to talk about listed building work and legislation.
The council said when signs were put up in the Kingsdown conservation area it was advised as long as it was not making ""significant or permanent changes to a building, which would alter its character, it was acceptable"".
English Heritage's letter, seen by the BBC, raised the ""potential cumulative impact"" of the signs in West Mall and Caledonia Place, which contains listed buildings.
""We would suggest that taken together such work might fall within Section 7 of the [Planning and Listed Buildings and Conservation 1990] Act,"" it said.

109,"Civil protection officials have already revealed that rescuers were let down by the Siresp emergency services network during the four-day disaster.
Now details have emerged of pleas for help that did not get through to commanders on the ground.
The government has ordered an investigation into the network.
The fire began in the Pedrógão Grande area during the afternoon on 17 June and within hours the failures of the emergency network, which relies on mobile antennas, were becoming clear.
The first failure came at 19:45 on 17 June. Three people dialled the 112 emergency number from an abandoned house in nearby Casalinho to report that the building was surrounded by flames. Emergency services tried to contact the local command post and the deputy commander but were unable to get through, according to a civil protection authority (ANPC) timeline, described by Portuguese media as a ""black box"".
Five minutes later, officials were unable to contact a command post to help a father and son in trouble a few kilometres away in Troviscais. These and several other cases are documented throughout the night by the Público and Jornal de Notícias websites.
At 01:02 on 18 June comes the most chilling entry on the civil protection authority's log, in a reference to the deaths of 47 people on a single stretch of the N-236 road. Thirty of the victims died in their cars. A district relief operations command appeals for help in tackling ""breakdowns in the Siresp network"" and for ""lifting the dead victims who are in the road, making it impossible for combat means to get through"".
The civil protection authority has already confirmed ""failures in the Siresp network"" that continued throughout the four-day emergency and on the Saturday evening, firefighters resorted to using their old radio network.
The government on Monday said it had asked for a study into Siresp's operation, particularly during serious accidents and disasters. Prime Minister Antonio Costa said last week that the network had suffered because cables and communication towers had been damaged by the fire. However, he said the mobile network had provided temporary mobile antennas.
The forest fires were the worst in Portugal's history, with 64 dead and 254 injured.
Portugal's Siresp (joint emergency and security network system) has had a chequered past. It was set up in 2006 as a partnership between the government and private sector.
The system stopped working during a rescue attempt in storms in January 2013 and it was linked to the deaths of two firefighters a few months later.","At least 10 emergency calls failed to reach firefighters last week during the forest fires in which 64 people died, reports say.",40415815

Blatter, 79, and vice-president Michel Platini have both been suspended for 90 days amid corruption allegations, which both men deny.
Platini is seeking the next presidency, as is Prince Ali bin al-Hussein.
Frenchman Platini, president of European football's governing body Uefa, submitted his candidacy papers earlier this month, but Fifa says it cannot recognise his candidacy while his ban is in place and he cannot campaign.
However, Fifa's electoral committee says it may allow him to stand if his suspension ends before the election date.
Shaikh Salman bin Ebrahim Al Khalifa of Bahrain is expected to contest the election. Former Trinidad and Tobago midfielder David Nakhid said he will stand, while ex-Tottenham defender Ramon Vega is considering doing likewise.
South Korean Chung Mong-joon, another confirmed candidate, claimed his campaign has been ""sabotaged"" by a six-year ban from Fifa's ethics committee. On Tuesday, the 64-year-old's bid to lift the ban was rejected a Zurich district court.
Swiss Blatter is under criminal investigation over claims he made a £1.35m payment to Platini in 2011, as well as allegations he signed a contract ""unfavourable"" to Fifa.

116,"Announcing his decision, Dane County District Attorney Ishmael Ozanne said police officer Matt Kenny had been attacked and feared for his life.
Nineteen-year-old Tony Robinson Jr, who was mixed race and unarmed, was shot on 6 March in a Madison apartment.
His death sparked protests in the state capitol building, one of a series of US police shootings to raise tensions.
More protesters with banners saying ""Black lives matter"" gathered in Madison after the attorney made his announcement on Tuesday.
Mr Robinson's mother, Andrea Irwin, vowed to continue the ""fight"" as she addressed a crowd of supporters outside Grace Episcopal Church.
Earlier, Mr Ozanne had said: ""This tragic and unfortunate death was the result of a lawful use of deadly police force and no charges should be brought against Kenny.""
Officer Kenny was responding to an emergency call about a man obstructing traffic who had allegedly been involved in an assault, when he confronted Robinson.
On the night of the shooting, Robinson had various illicit drugs in his system, according to autopsy reports.
His friends who made multiple 911 calls said he was ""acting crazy"" and tried to choke one of them. They said he attacked people on the sidewalk and was running in front of cars, Mr Ozanne said.
Mr Kenny drew his firearm before entering the apartment building Robinson was in and he claims he was attacked by Robinson at the top of the stairs.
He said he feared he would be knocked down the stairs and Robinson would take his gun, and he fired seven shots at him.
But Mr Robinson's relatives, and many of the Wisconsin protesters, insist he is a victim of police brutality.

117,"The list of 198 firms owed a total of £466,219 in arrears and included football clubs, recruitment firms, care homes and hairdressers.
Top of the list was a London restaurant which owed almost £100,000 to 30 employees.
The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said all the money owed had been paid back to workers.
The list was the largest of its kind since the ""naming and shaming"" scheme was introduced in October 2013.
The department said 688 employers in total have been publicly identified for flouting the law, with total arrears of more than £3.5m.
Business Minister Margot James said: ""It is not acceptable that some employers fail to pay at least the minimum wage their workers are entitled to.
""So we'll continue to crack down on those who ignore the law, including by naming and shaming them.""
Restaurant San Lorenzo in Wimbledon, South West London, owed £99,541.98 to 30 workers, while Premier Recruitment Ltd in Derby owed £34,797.33 to 424 workers.
Also on the list were football clubs Blackpool FC and Brighton and Hove Albion, which owed £2,861.64 to one worker.
Brighton and Hove Albion said its reputation had been ""unfairly tarnished"" by its inclusion on the list, claiming the case was a ""minor administrative error"" which resulted from being ""over generous"" in paying expenses to someone on work experience two years ago.
A spokesman for the club insisted: ""We are one of the few clubs who pays its staff over and above the National Living Wage.""
TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady called for the ""worst offenders"" to be prosecuted, adding: ""Bosses who try to duck the minimum wage must have nowhere to hide.
""The level of underpayment in some cases is truly eye-watering.""
The list comes after the new National Living Wage was introduced in April, requiring employers to pay at least £7.20 an hour to employees aged 25 and over.
However, the Living Wage Foundation calculates that a rate of £8.25 per hour is required to meet the cost of living, rising to £9.40 in London. Some employers pay this higher living wage voluntarily.
The National Living Wage of £6.70 an hour applies to workers aged 21 to 24, with lower rates for younger people and apprentices.
The government's list includes firms that have failed to pay either the minimum wage or the National Living Wage.
Conor D'Arcy from think tank the Resolution Foundation backed the government's policy of naming and shaming but added: ""With the number of people on the wage floor set to treble over the next four years, the government will need to strengthen its resources for enforcing both the national minimum wage and the national living wage.""

Over 800 sightings were also reported in neighbouring Singapore last month, sparking intense online debate.
The Lyssa Zampa tropical moth, which is also known as the Laos brown butterfly, is native to South East Asia.
Biology lecturer N Sivasothi said that while the moth sightings appear to be ""unprecedented"", it is not a new phenomenon.
""The moths are actually present during other times of the year but in very small numbers, so they are usually not noticed by people,"" Mr Sivasothi said, adding that the creatures typically emerge between April and August every year.
Ecologist Anuj Jain said moths' use of light for navigation often causes them to head to built-up areas.
""Their tendency to emigrate in search of new uneaten host plants attracts these moths to light in urban city areas,"" he said.
Experts said that while people suffering from asthma may be sensitive to hairs on their wings, the nocturnal creatures do not pose any threat.
""The moths are harmless and the public has nothing to be afraid of,"" said Lena Chan, Director of the National Biodiversity Centre at the National Parks Board in Singapore.
""There is no need for people to protect themselves against these moths as they do not cause any allergies or diseases. In fact, they are important pollinators and are beautiful to watch.""
Many Malaysians and Singaporeans however, took to the internet to share their moth encounters and to upload photographs of the winged creatures.
Although many seemed to welcome the arrival of the furry insects, others remained cautious.

120,"This is according to a study revealing that 96% of the chicks are dying at two to three weeks old.
Conservationists say that human activity has driven the birds to one remaining wetland, but that that site has insufficient food for the ducks.
The research is published in the journal Bird Conservation International.
The Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust (WWT), which led the research, estimates that only 25 individual birds now remain in the wild.
Human activity, including deforestation, farming and fishing, has destroyed their habitat to the point that this last population is now restricted to one wetland in north-east Madagascar - a complex of lakes near Bemanevika.
After the rediscovery of the species at this site in 2006, the WWT and its partners, including the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and the Peregrine Fund, set up a conservation breeding programme and began to monitor the wild birds.
Dr Geoff Hilton, head of species research at the WWT, said that with such a small number of birds, keeping a close eye on the population was straightforward.
""We had about 10 or 11 females, [and] we were able to tell that most of those females were laying eggs, and those eggs were hatching,"" he told BBC News.
But at the point when the ducklings were two to three weeks old, they would start disappearing.
Piecing the evidence together, including samples of food from the bottom of the lake, the researchers realised that the chicks were starving to death.
These diving ducks feed from the bottom of lakes, and this steep crater lake was simply too deep for them.
WWT senior research officer Dr Andrew Bamford, who led the study, said: ""The last refuge of the Madagascar pochard is one of the last unspoilt wetlands in the country, but it's simply not suited to its needs.
""Something similar happened in the UK when the lowland red kite became confined to upland Wales, and in Hawaii, where the last nenes survived only on the upper slopes of volcanoes because introduced predators had occupied their favoured grassland habitats.""
Dr Hilton added: ""What we think we're seeing is a bit of a classic wildlife conservation conundrum.
""The place where the species hangs on at the end is not a particularly good place for them - it's just the place that's been least badly affected by human activities.""
But the researchers say the species could thrive in Madagascar again if the captive-bred ducks can be found a new wetland home.
""We have been very successful in establishing a captive population,"" said Dr Hilton.
""And we have recently identified a lake that we think has potential to be restored and become a reintroduction site.
""The main thing we have to do is work with the local people to reintroduce and restore the pochard, but also to restore the lake and help people to get a better livelihood from the lake they live around.""

It is making a recommendation in response to there being ""fewer consultant paediatricians available.""
The plans will be discussed at a full health board meeting on 24 November.
The PACU cares for children who experience sudden pain, high temperatures, sickness, infections, or requirements for dressings, blood tests, x-rays or scans.
If the recommendation is accepted, it would mean the PACU would be open daily from 10:00 to 1800 GMT instead of 10:00 to 22:00.
Sick children who require assessment after the new closing time would be referred or transferred by ambulance to Glangwili Hospital in Carmarthen.
The health board said the move to reduce hours in the short term was the result of ""longstanding difficulties in recruiting paediatric consultants across the UK"".
This coincided with the retirement of a Pembrokeshire paediatric consultant and the maternity leave of another.
The health board said to do nothing would be a ""risk.""
There is also a recommendation to merge the on-call rota with the one operating in Carmarthenshire.
This means that if there was a paediatric out-of-hours emergency at Withybush Hospital, the on-call paediatric consultants would offer remote advice.
The health board's chief executive Steve Moore said: ""It is our duty to be realistic about the availability of our consultants and to plan care around this so that it is safe, consistent and to avoid public confusion.

130,"James Male, Andrew Bridge, Steve Warren and Paul Goslin died when Cheeki Rafiki, the yacht they were sailing, capsized in the North Atlantic.
Prosecutors at Winchester Crown Court said yacht manager Douglas Innes failed to get it checked ahead of its trip.
Mr Innes, of Stormforce Coaching, denies four counts of manslaughter by gross negligence.
The 42-year-old, of Whitworth Crescent, Southampton, also denies a further charge of failing to ensure the vessel was operated in a safe manner.
Prosecutor Nigel Lickley QC also outlined to the court how the yacht had been given a category 2 code, which meant it was only authorised to be used commercially up to 60 miles away from a ""safe haven"".
The code certificate had expired shortly before the tragedy, he added.
The men were returning from Antigua Sailing Week to Southampton when the vessel overturned in May 2014.
The court heard that after receiving an urgent email from Andrew Bridge on board the yacht, Mr Innes, who was in a pub at the time, did not call the coastguard but instead went to another pub where Mr Bridge phoned saying the situation had worsened.
Mr Innes returned home, called the coastguard and emailed the crew suggesting they check the bolts of the keel.
Mr Lickley said it was a ""tragedy"" that they would eventually discover a number of bolts had failed or broken, causing the keel to detach from the yacht.
He said: ""Some had failed and were broken and had been for some time,"" before the yacht left the UK in October 2013.
Skipper Mr Bridge, 22, from Farnham in Surrey, Mr Male, 22, from Romsey, Hampshire, Mr Warren, 52, from Bridgwater in Somerset and Mr Goslin, 56, from West Camel in Somerset, died after the yacht lost its keel more than 700 miles from Nova Scotia in Canada.
The yacht was found by a container ship on 17 May, two days after Mr Bridge's urgent email, with its life raft still on board.
Mr Lickley told jurors the keel's loss would have caused a ""rapid capsize"" and the men on deck would have been ""jettisoned"" into the water while those inside would have been trapped.
He added: ""What is clear from two of the emergency beacons used by Andrew Bridge and James Male is that they may have survived for some time, most probably in the water, that is until they were lost too.""

An estimated 20% of petrol stations have either run dry or are low on supplies.
In their posts, French social media users talk about films such as Total Recall, the title of both a 1990 and 2012 science fiction film. Total is also the name of a French multinational oil and gas company.
Some users also changed film titles to reflect the shortage: Pulp Fiction was renamed Pump Friction, The Full Monty became The Fuel Monty and Mad Max: Fury Bicycle Lane replaced Mad Max: Fury Road.
American actor Vin Diesel's surname and his Hollywood blockbusters attracted particular attention, with people inventing several titles for his Fast and Furious series: Last and Furious, Pas Fast Mais Furious (translation: Not Fast But Furious), Immobile and Furious and Fuel Furious.
Others renamed 8 Mile, a semi-biographical drama staring US rapper Eminem, 0 Mile and 8 Miles a Pied (translation: 8 Miles on Foot).

He only noticed the unfortunate cat after hearing ""meowing"" coming from the walls.
""I couldn't believe it at first,"" said Mr Baird.
He used a drill, chisel and hammer to free Francee before posting a video of the unlikely cat rescue on Facebook in an effort to track down the owner.
The video has since been shared more than 700 times and Francee has been reunited with her owner, a little shocked but uninjured from her ordeal.
According to Mr Baird, the cat got stuck in a tiny cavity space after apparently clambering a ladder to the first floor.
""The only way in would have been from above so she must've climbed up and then got stuck down in between the wall.
""It's fortunate I came up to the house or the cat would not have been found.
""It was a small cavity space in the wall. I was able to pull some of the insulation out and then I got some tools to free her,"" said Mr Baird.
""I'm just happy I was able to get the cat back home again and everything worked out OK.""
He added, with a laugh: ""My phone hasn't stopped since I posted the video. But all I wanted was to find the cat's owner and I'm glad I could do that.""",A cat in Carrickfergus was lucky to keep its nine lives after getting trapped in the wall of a partly-built house.,40303872
139,"Shamsul Arefin brought four people from his native Bangladesh to work at the Stewart Hotel near Appin in Argyll over a three year period.
His victims took out loans to pay him substantial sums for employment at the hotel. One was threatened with having his kidney removed by money lenders back home if he didn't pay his debt.
Arefin's crimes were  described as a ""clear case of modern day slavery"".
At Fort William Sheriff Court, he was found guilty of breaches of the Asylum and Immigration Act.
He carried out the crimes between 2008 and 2010. He recruited his victims by offering them jobs as chefs at his hotel.
They were told to pay him substantial sums of money which he described as a ""deposit"" in exchange for employment and a salary.
On their arrival at the hotel, their wages were reduced to a fraction of the contracted amount and they were required to work far longer hours with their duties extended beyond the kitchen.
The men told how they had to paint the hotel, clean rooms and cut and move logs in the hotel grounds in freezing winter temperatures.
Arefin threatened his victims with termination of their employment when they complained and refused to return the money they had paid him.
In one case the victim described how money lenders in Bangladesh had threatened to remove his kidney as a result of his inability to pay back what he owed.
The crimes came to light following an investigation by the UK Border Agency and the then Northern Constabulary.
Responding to Arefin's sentencing, Kath Harper, the Crown's national lead prosecutor for human trafficking, said: ""Arefin's greed had life-changing implications not just for his victims, but for their families and others who supported them.
""Human trafficking can come in many forms and as prosecutors we are committed to doing all we can do eradicate it from Scotland.""
Kevin Hyland, independent anti-slavery commissioner, added: ""The victims of these particular crimes endured exploitation and abuse many thought was a distant memory of the past.
""This is a clear case of 'modern day slavery' and I commend the bravery of the four men who gave evidence at the trial. I hope that receiving justice in the courts assists in their journey of recovery.""
Det Insp Richard Baird from Police Scotland said: ""Shamsul Arefin was driven by financial greed and held no regard for the working conditions of those in his employment.
""This was apparent by the poor condition that his victims were subject to through working long hours at no extra pay and often with substandard equipment and working supplies.
""In bringing this individual to justice we have disrupted, if not dismantled, one more illegal enterprise and hopefully saved other potential victims from inevitable suffering.""",A former hotel owner has been jailed for three years for human trafficking.,33653553
145,"The 14-time major champion, who has twice undergone surgery during 15 months out, is nine shots off the pace set by fellow American JB Holmes.
Woods, 40, had four birdies in eight holes but he bogeyed the ninth after a wayward drive and poor chip.
Another shot went on the 11th, while double bogeys on the 16th and 18th left the world number 898 a stroke over par.
Woods said he ""felt pretty good"" and ""looking forward to the next few days"" after completing his round at the event he hosts to benefit his charitable foundation.
""I hit the ball in three bushes and the water, so it could have been something really good,"" he said on Sky Sports.
""I got off to a solid start but then I made a few mistakes. I didn't play the par fives particularly well. ""I had some awkward shots.  If you drive great you can take advantage of this golf course, but if you don't you can end up in bushes or rocks and go sideways.""
His first double bogey came after he pulled his approach to the green from the centre of the 16th fairway and was forced to chip out short of the green. He over-hit his fourth and two putted from the back edge for a six.
Woods then pulled his drive on the par-four 18th into a lake and although he hit the pin with his fourth shot, he two-putted from 12 feet for the fourth six of his round.
He had briefly tied for the lead at four under after a run of three birdies from the sixth hole as he played the first nine holes in three-under-par 33.
And although he cancelled out his bogey on the 11th with a birdie on the 15th, his two late double bogeys blotted an otherwise encouraging round.
Holmes leads the 18-man event after an eight-under-par 64 that featured seven birdies and an eagle.

147,"Its leader, Heinz Christian Strache, said the way postal votes were handled was among numerous irregularities.
""We are not sore losers,"" he said. ""This is about protecting the foundations of democracy.""
The party's candidate was defeated by the former Green Party leader by just under 31,000 votes.
The filing of the challenge was confirmed by Christian Neuwirth, a spokesman for Austria's constitutional court.
The court now has four weeks to respond. If it takes the full four weeks, its findings will come just two days before the poll winner, Alexander Van der Bellen, is due to be sworn in.
Is Europe lurching to the far right?
Europe's nationalist surge, country by country
Is populism a threat to Europe's economies?
The presidency is a largely ceremonial post, but a victory for the Freedom Party could have been a springboard for success in the next parliamentary elections, scheduled for 2018.
Correspondents say the legal challenge threatens to renew divisions created by the vote, which split Austria and exposed, once again, deep differences in Europe over how to deal with the migrant crisis, the economy and how to balance national interests against those of the EU.
Mr Van der Bellen was declared the winner of the election the day after voting, with 50.3% of the vote against Mr Hofer's 49.7% - despite preliminary results placing the Freedom Party's Norbert Hofer slightly ahead.
But the Freedom Party is alleging numerous irregularities in its 150-page submission to the constitutional court.
Mr Strache says he has filed evidence that postal ballots were illegally handled in 94 of 117 district election offices, reports said, suggesting that more than 570,000 ballots could have been affected by this.
The party also claims it has evidence that under-16s and foreigners were allowed to vote.
""The extent of irregularities is more than terrifying. That's why I feel obliged to challenge the result,"" Mr Strache told a news conference.
""You don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to have a bad gut feeling about this whole election. Without these irregularities Mr Hofer could have become president.""
The BBC's Bethany Bell in Vienna says that if the constitutional court accepts the evidence presented by Mr Strache, there could be several possible outcomes, including a partial recount or a fresh vote in affected areas.
But the court will have to decide whether the law was broken and whether any possible breaches would have affected the outcome of the election.","Austria's far-right Freedom Party has lodged a legal challenge to the result of last month's presidential election, which it lost by a tiny margin.",36478264
148,"The report suggested splitting the current role, as both head of the legal system and president of the States.
Political expert Dr Adrian Lee said the dual role was unique to the islands.
He said they were the only democratic jurisdictions in the world where the person judging a case had been involved in making the law.
The Carswell Committee, which authored the report, suggested Jersey's Bailiff should step down as president of the States of Jersey and be replaced by an elected speaker.
Lord Carswell said: ""There are various international constitutional documents, which rather frown on the idea of judges having anything to do with the legislator.""
He said there was also a practical reason, as in recent years the Jersey Bailiff had had to spend increasing amounts of time on States work.
Dr Lee, a former professor of politics at Plymouth University, said: ""The Carswell Committee also made the point that as the two islands increasingly develop their international personalities, as they're called, it's important that their legal systems and political systems are clear to the outside world.
""At the moment there is some lack of clarity over who is speaking on behalf of, who's representing the island - is it the chief minister, the Lieutenant Governor, the Bailiff or is it all three?""

151,"The official ONA news agency said they were flown on Wednesday out of Yemen's capital, Sanaa, which is controlled by the Houthi rebel movement.
The US government had requested Oman's help in finding them, it added.
The ministry gave no details on the Americans' identities, but one Yemeni security official told the Reuters news agency had been held by the rebels.
""The three Americans were detained by the security forces run by the Houthis and were held on suspicion of spying,"" the official said by telephone from Sanaa.
Earlier this month, the US state department said an American contractor for the United Nations who was detained at Sanaa's airport last month had died.
John Hamen and a colleague - reportedly also American - were held as they arrived on a UN aircraft from Djibouti.
In September, two Americans held hostage for months by the Houthis were freed and flown to safety in Oman, along with a British citizen and three Saudis.
The rebels, who ousted Yemen's government from Sanaa this year, are facing an air and ground campaign by a multinational coalition led by Saudi Arabia and backed by the US.
Oman, which is not part of the coalition, has played an active role in efforts to negotiate an end to the conflict.

152,"It has been waiting on a review of the Russian Proton rocket, which failed on its last outing in May while carrying a Mexican payload.
Inmarsat's third Global Xpress platform was due to be the next passenger and was grounded as a consequence.
The launch on the Proton is now set for 28 August from Baikonur, Kazakhstan.
Lift-off will be at 17:44 local time (12:44 BST).
Inmarsat is the world's largest mobile satellite services operator.
Its principal customer base is the shipping sector, but the company also caters for any groups that need telecommunications away from a fixed line. These include oil and gas installations, the aviation sector, armed forces, aid agencies and NGOs in disaster areas, and TV news crews reporting from trouble zones.
Its new £1bn GX network is the biggest commercial UK space project in the process of being rolled out right now.
It is designed to incorporate three spacecraft distributed around the globe to give worldwide coverage.
Two have already gone up, to relay telecommunications from Asia all the way across to the Americas.
The upcoming launch should complete the network over the Pacific, and give customers seamless coverage wherever they are - something that is especially important to the shipping and aviation sectors.
Investigators are now confident they understand the loss of May's Proton.
The natural vibration in the rocket's third stage loosened bolts that held a turbopump in place for a steering engine.
The disruption ultimately broke an oxidizer line and led to the pump shutting down, and the loss of the engine.
Measures have been put in place to make sure this cannot happen again.
The Proton has had a torrid record of late.
Six vehicles and their payloads have been lost in the past five years, and Inmarsat's GX network is roughly a year behind schedule because of all the problems the rocket system has experienced.
""The return to flight is typically the best flight to be on because there is extra caution, extra controls,"" Michele Franci, Inmarsat's Chief Technical Officer, told BBC News.
The new satellite is insured, but the company has taken the additional precaution of ordering a fourth platform from manufacturer Boeing. This would be available in mid-2016 should anything go wrong this month.
Global Xpress sees Inmarsat take its first, firm step into Ka frequencies to deliver communications.
Traditionally, its spacecraft have worked in the L-band.
The higher frequency of Ka allows faster throughput connections, giving the new satellites broadband speeds that are 100 times faster than the company's previous generation of spacecraft.
""If there has been any benefit from the delay, it's that it has allowed us to fix network issues that we would have had anyway in this period,"" said Mr Franci
""So, once we go really live at the end of the year, the network will be more stable and more reliable. But we could definitely have done without the delays, that's for sure.""

157,"Developers claim the 100MW project at Glenmuckloch, near Kirckconnel, could generate power for more than a century.
It is the latest in a series of renewable energy schemes planned for the site, which is owned by Buccleuch Estates.
They are part of a project to redevelop the opencast mine as Glenmuckloch Energy Park.
The details have emerged in a scoping report for the pumped storage hydro scheme submitted to Dumfries and Galloway Council.
Buccleuch Estates has joined with mining company Hargreaves and 2020 Renewables to draw up the plans.
It will involve creating two reservoirs - one higher than the other - which will be connected by a tunnel with a pump-turbine.
The report states: ""When excess electricity exists within the grid the pump-turbines go into pumping mode lifting water to the upper pond and when demand within the network exceeds available supply the pump-turbines reverse and change to generating mode with water released from the upper pond.""
If the project goes ahead, the lower reservoir will be created from the existing opencast void, while a second, upper pond will be excavated at the head of Halfmerk Hill.
The higher reservoir will have a water depth of 22m (72 feet), creating 3.3million cubic metres of water storage.
The redevelopment of Glenmuckloch follows the collapse of surface mining firm Aardvark TMC in 2013, leaving a shortfall in the money needed to restore the site to its pre-opencast condition.
However since then Buccleuch Estates and Hargreaves have worked to implement a rolling programme of restoration in parallel with coaling operations.
Later this summer two community wind turbines will be built to the west of the hydro site.

The trust said it was awaiting a report to be published and would not comment.
The other trusts currently in special measures include East Kent Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust and Medway NHS Foundation Trust.
Medway's Maritime Hospital was forced to turn away ambulances earlier, and on Wednesday, to help ease the burden on its A&E department.
The East Sussex trust was rated as ""inadequate"" by the Care Quality Commission (CQC) in March, after failing to meeting government targets.
In May, it was criticised by Eastbourne Borough Council, which passed a vote of no confidence in its management.
And in July the chief executive resigned while the trust had to apologise after patients' details were found in the street.
Leadership would appear to be the big problem at this trust. In its March report, the CQC described a ""disconnect between the trust board and it's staff"" and a ""culture where staff were afraid to speak out"".
The trust's problems have been well documented but what has apparently been lacking is any real progress in putting things right.
It's my understanding the CQC feel very little has improved in the last few months.
Friday's meeting between all the stakeholders will be a chance to discuss the way forward but many people I have spoken to in the wider NHS believe special measures will be imposed on the trust.

The 47-year-old said the music desks were often covered in dust, which may have had asbestos particles.
Hackney Council said it had not received a formal claim and could not investigate until it did.
Ms Doughty said she had spent a lot of time in the music room each week rehearsing plays.
""We used to sit on the desks and have to wipe white dust off them,"" she said.
""There were two heavy doors at the entrance to the music room and these would constantly slam, shaking the room. The school was in pretty bad repair so maybe the dust came down from the ceiling when the door closed.""
Ms Doughty said if it was proved the music room was the cause of her cancer, then it was ""possible that many others have been affected"".
""I wanted to raise awareness of this and to appeal for anyone else who has been affected, pupils or teachers, to get in touch.""
Ms Doughty's lawyers, Slater and Gordon, have found that asbestos ceiling tiles were in place during the time that she was a pupil at the school.

Each one has that certain je ne sais quoi that lifts them out of the humdrum and makes them exceptional.
As far as Singapore goes, it's no surprise it has become second only to Monaco as the place where most business gets done over a grand prix weekend. It's a place you just really want to go.
That message permeates, and has made it into one of the most desirable races on the calendar.
For a start, the ambience is terrific - and, let's be honest, this is what appeals to the business visitors, rather than the demands of racing on one of the longest tracks in F1 in crippling humidity.
Singapore is a fascinating destination full stop, thanks to its place at the crossroads of south-east Asia and colonial past. But hosting the race at night adds an extra dimension.
The track jags through the city centre under lights, Chinese lanterns adding a dash of colour, the futuristic city skyline the backdrop.
As the sun sets, the whole place seems to shimmer and sparkle for a while. Darkness takes the edge off the tropical heat, and a heady, luscious tropical atmosphere settles over the place.
For those working at the race, there's a surreal edge to it, too.
Know someone who volunteers in sport and deserves recognition for their efforts? Give them the chance to shine by nominating them.
First track sessions at dusk, qualifying and race after dark means staying on European time. So you wake up at 2pm, finish work in the early hours and go to bed at six in the morning.
You can eat in a hotel restaurant, some of which stay open all night for the race weekend. Better, though, to head to an all-night hawkers' market, where delicious, cheap local food is on offer from a myriad of stalls and you can drink in the atmosphere of the place.
Oh, and the track is pretty good, too. It's no Spa or Suzuka, but the Marina Bay Circuit has a challenge all of its own.
A long, long lap, a nearly two-hour race, bumps, 23 corners and intense humidity make it arguably the toughest grand prix on the calendar - only Malaysia comes close.

""Eagles are big, powerful birds; they should not be flown in built-up areas. And secondly in terms of the safety of the bird, you're asking it to grab hold of a drone, which often have four rotating blades keeping it in the air,"" she said.

Now, the farming of the shellfish has taken off, secured the highest quality rating and are due to be sold locally.
Roger Hall, from the Porlock Futures Community Interest Company, said it had been a ""brilliantly successful trial"".
Using oysters from Morecambe Bay in Lancashire, trials were set up to establish whether the shellfish could be farmed in the seas around Porlock.
""We've proved the oysters not only grow but have got the best Class A classification for cleanliness you can get,"" said Mr Hall.
""It's the realisation of what started off as an interesting idea and now we've got 70 trestles with thousands of oysters on them all waiting to be eaten in the restaurants.""

180,"Capped 94 times, Phillips' comments come as criticism has been levelled at coach Rob Howley for failing to bring new players into the Wales team.
As they prepare to face France, Wales have capped just three new players since the 2015 World Cup, but Phillips says he understands the situation.
""You can't just blood youngsters because they are young,"" he said.
Since 2015, only Blues flanker Ellis Jenkins, Newport Gwent Dragons lock Cory Hill and Ospreys fly-half Sam Davies have been handed their senior debuts.
In Wales' final Six Nations clash in Paris, there have been calls for Howley to have one eye on the future and play new faces.
Instead the has stuck with the same side that beat Ireland last time out.
This comes despite Howley having a host of uncapped players in his squad in the shape of Ospreys flanker Olly Cracknell and lock Rory Thornton, Leicester fly-half Owen Williams, Scarlets wing Steffan Evans, Dragons wing Ashton Hewitt, Scarlets scrum-half Aled Davies and Wasps flanker Thomas Young.

Howley has also ignored calls for Davies to start at fly-half and for Ospreys' teenager Keelan Giles to come in on the wing.
Phillips said he agreed with Howley's decision and that he believed the onus was on the young players to show they are ready for the senior side.
""There's a few guys on the verge, but those youngsters have still got to learn,"" Phillips told BBC Radio Wales.
""They are young and developing, but they will get their time in seasons to come. But they've got to improve in training and show Rob that they deserve to be first-choice players.""
Against France, Phillips believes Howley has got his selection spot on.
He added: ""It's a difficult one. In that international jersey should be the best because you are the best in the position. You should not just hand out caps willy-nilly to people.
""The development of the future is an important thing, but that needs to be done in a structured way.

The scheme is a partnership between Dudley Council and the Black Country Reinvestment Society (BCRS).
Councillor Shaukat Ali said he believed it could play a ""vital role"" in stimulating the local economy.
He said there were some 9,000 businesses in the area that could be eligible.
The scheme, offering loans of £10,000 to £50,000, is open to small and medium-sized businesses with a turnover of less than £5m.
The scheme has been joint funded by the council and BCRS through a European grant.
Paul Kalinaucas, chief executive of the BCRS not-for-profit lender, said the fund would help Dudley ""develop, grow and prosper"".

182,"Transgender protesters forced a halt to debate on the bill on Wednesday.
Last month, the state approved a human rights measure banning gender identity discrimination at public facilities.
In recent weeks, two other states passed laws ensuring equal access to gender-segregated facilities for transgender students.
The bill in Arizona's Republican-dominated legislature would make it a misdemeanour offence to use a public toilet, bathroom, shower, bath, dressing room or changing room associated with a gender other than what is on one's birth certificate.
Penalties could include six months in prison.
""If you look like a man and you live your life like a man, you should be able to use a man's bathroom,"" said Dru Levasseur, a transgender rights lawyer for the advocacy group Lambda Legal.
But John Kavanagh, the Republican lawmaker who sponsored the bill, said he feared criminals might take advantage of the situation and expose themselves to children of the opposite gender.
""This law simply restores the law of society: men are men and women are women,"" Mr Kavanagh said, according to the Associated Press.
""For a handful of people to make everyone else uncomfortable just makes no sense.""
But, Mr Kavanagh added, police would be allowed to use their discretion over whether to press charges if women used the men's room to avoid a long queue.
On Wednesday, Mr Kavanagh agreed to postpone a vote on the bill at the start of a hearing filled with dozens of transgender activists.
The bill's opponents say it would force transgender people to reveal themselves and risk harassment,
""Most transgender people try to slip through public places without being noticed,'' activist Erica Keppler said.
""This will turn us into criminals.""
And advocates say transgender people can find it difficult to change gender on their birth certificates because many states require proof of gender treatment surgery.
Meanwhile, other states such as Idaho and Ohio do not allow such changes at all, the American Civil Liberties Union said.
It is already illegal to discriminate against transgender people in 16 US states, although the extent of protections can vary, the group added.

An online appeal set up by beautician Katie Cutler raised £330,135.
Richard Gatiss, 25, from Gateshead, had pleaded guilty to assault with intent to rob at Newcastle Crown Court.
After the sentencing, Mr Barnes said it was ""just about the right length of time"" and he hoped prison would give Gatiss time to reflect on what he had done.
""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful,"" he said.
Gatiss, from Split Crow Road, was caught after police retrieved DNA evidence from a pocket on Mr Barnes' jacket.
He had been desperate for money to buy legal highs but ran off empty-handed when Mr Barnes shouted for help, the court heard.
Judge Paul Sloan QC described Gatiss' actions as ""despicable and opportunistic"" and said he had picked on Mr Barnes because he was vulnerable.
Mr Barnes has lived with disabilities from birth after his mother contracted German measles when she was pregnant. He is visually impaired and stands 4ft 6in (1.21m) tall.
After the hearing, Mr Barnes, who was joined by 21-year-old Miss Cutler, said: ""I'm pleased he's been sentenced and I think the sentence of four years is just about the right length.
""I hope while he's in prison he'll do some thinking and when he comes out he'll do something useful. Maybe he might decide to help people, which I think would be a good idea for him.
""It's sad that he was brought to the stage of doing something like this - not necessarily just me, it could have been anybody and they might not have got over the incident.
""But I've moved on,"" he said.
Holding back tears, Miss Cutler added: ""It's hard for me to talk about Richard as it wasn't me who was attacked, but I just hope he gets the help that he deserves.
""I'm just glad that that some good has come from this and we can move forward.""
While on remand, Gatiss was kept in segregation for his own safety.
Jamie Adams, defending, said it was ""an awful case"" but publicity surrounding it made it difficult to ""keep a proper outlook on what the sentence should be"".
On the prison bus to court Gatiss had been ""the subject of some pretty awful double-standard behaviour"" from other inmates, Mr Adams said.
""Life is not easy for him. He is going to be in the public glare for a long time to come and he knows that.""

188,"A University College London team spoke to paediatricians at 177 hospitals in England and Wales and found poor knowledge on identifying underweight children and serious complications.
This was despite most respondents having experience of treating a child with an eating disorder.
The Royal College of Paediatrics said it was working to improve training.
Study leader Dr Lee Hudson from the Institute of Child Health, University College London, said more under-13s now presented with eating disorders than meningitis due to the success of vaccination programmes.
This shift in childhood illness may be one reason why his research suggested a lack of knowledge on spotting underweight children and the associated medical problems, he added.
In the study, one on-call paediatrician was questioned in every hospital providing acute in-patient care for children.
During a phone interview they were asked how they would identify if a child was underweight and what clinical examinations they would carry out to check for severe or potentially life-threatening complications.
Only half said they would use Body Mass Index to decide if older children or adolescents were underweight, as advised in international guidelines.
And only one in five said they would adjust that for appropriate cut-offs in children.
There was also a lack of awareness of signs and symptoms of complications in children whose weight had dropped to seriously low levels.
The researchers were particularly concerned that only 13% knew a specific danger sign to look for in tests checking that the heart was working properly, the team reported in Archives of Diseases in Childhood.
Doctors also scored poorly on knowledge of dangerous complications associated with giving nutrition to someone who has not eaten for a while or is severely malnourished.
Dr Hudson said this was not a criticism of doctors because eating disorders tended to present with vague symptoms, but highlighted a gap in training.
""In addition to that, services for children with eating disorders are very hit and miss around the country.""
But he stressed that as those surveyed would be the first paediatricians to assess such children, especially out of hours, they needed to know how to spot dangerously underweight children and teenagers and signs of severe complications.
""From previous research we know that a third of children who are underweight present with life-threatening features,"" he added.
Prof Russell Viner, a co-author of the study but also a member of the Royal College of Paediatrics Nutrition Committee, said the college was aware there was a training need around eating disorders and underweight issues.
""We are refreshing training on adolescent health,"" he said.
""And in association with the Department of Health and the Royal College of Psychiatry we are developing a training programme around mental health in adolescents.""","Doctors may be failing to spot tell-tale signs in children who are underweight, a study suggests.",21387993
189,"Couples will now be allowed to have two children, it said, citing a statement from the Communist Party.
The controversial policy was introduced nationally in 1979, to slow the population growth rate.
It is estimated to have prevented about 400 million births. However concerns at China's ageing population led to pressure for change.
Couples who violated the one-child policy faced a variety of punishments, from fines and the loss of employment to forced abortions.
Over time, the policy has been relaxed in some provinces, as demographers and sociologists raised concerns about rising social costs and falling worker numbers.
The decision to allow families to have two children was designed ""to improve the balanced development of population'' and to deal with an aging population, according to the statement from the Community Party's Central Committee carried by the official Xinhua News Agency (in Chinese) on Thursday.
Currently about 30% of China's population is over the age of 50. The total population of the country is around 1.36 billion.
The Communist Party began formally relaxing national rules two years ago, allowing couples in which at least one of the pair is an only child to have a second child.

What was China's one-child policy?
Trauma and sympathy shared online
Correspondents say that despite the relaxation of the rules, many couples may opt to only have one child, as one-child families have become the social norm.
Critics say that even a two-child policy will not boost the birth rate enough, the BBC's John Sudworth reports.
And for those women who want more than two children, nor will it end the state's insistence on the right to control their fertility, he adds.
""As long as the quotas and system of surveillance remains, women still do not enjoy reproductive rights,"" Maya Wang of Human Rights Watch told AFP.
I was born in 1979, the year the one-child policy was implemented. And even then, I wasn't supposed to be born.
In my parents' work unit, there were also quotas for babies. By the time my mother announced her pregnancy, the quotas were all used up for the year.
But kind-hearted officials decided to look the other way and allowed my birth. My would-be siblings were less lucky.
As a result of the policy, my mother had to endure two abortions. Even today, she talks about 'Number Two' and 'Number Three' and what they might have been like.

British Gas's price change takes effect on 16 March, while EDF's kicks in eight days later.
The moves benefit customers on a standard domestic gas tariff.
Britain's big six energy suppliers have been under pressure to pass on savings to customers after a 57% drop in wholesale gas prices since this time last year.
E.On was the first to announce a cut this year of 5.1%, followed by similar reductions by SSE, Scottish Power and Npower.
Executive director at consumer group Which?, Richard Lloyd, said :""Seeing all of the big suppliers mirror each other with small cuts in the face of falling wholesale prices will raise questions in many people's minds about whether competition is working in this market.""
British Gas, which is owned by Centrica, said 6.8 million of its customers on dual-fuel deals would see an average annual saving of Â£31 due to the 5.1% cut.
It said customers on so-called ""fix and fall"" tariffs would also benefit from the price reduction.
EDF said about 900,000 of its customers would also make an annual saving of Â£31.
It said it had no exit fees on any of its fixed deals.
Beatrice Bigois, managing director of customers at EDF, said: ""Our prices are under constant review and today's announcement reflects falls in wholesale gas costs.""
Centrica's Mark Hodges, chief executive of its energy supply and services in UK and Ireland, said: ""Competitive pricing is the way to retain existing customers and win new business in this hard-fought market.""
Some commentators warn that these types of ""standard"" tariffs are among the most expensive, so there is still benefit in shopping around.
Rachel Fletcher, Ofgem's senior partner for consumers and competition, said: ""These price cuts are a movement in the right direction for loyal customers, but they are dwarfed by the savings available by switching from a standard tariff to a fixed deal.
""You could save more money, up to Â£300, by switching.""
There was also criticism of the industry for failing to cut electricity tariffs, despite falling wholesale costs.
Energy analysts at Jefferies said: ""There has still been no movement in electricity tariffs, despite a 30% fall in wholesale electricity prices since August 2014.
""This is likely due to increased environmental costs, which fall on electricity rather than gas, and additional network charges.""
British Gas said it was unable to lower electricity prices due to rising costs, such as for network delivery, adding that wholesale costs only make up a third of electricity bills.

The current leader points to a surge in party membership under his stewardship as evidence that he is building a ""mass movement"" capable of winning a general election, with his allies saying the Tories are ""in retreat"".
But Mr Smith said: ""I think that's delusional, and I think Jeremy needs to think a bit more about that straight, honest politics that he started his campaign with.""

He added that much of the data collection had been carried out under an older piece of law - section 94 of the Telecommunications Act 1984.
""It gave absolutely no clue at all that it could be used for this particular purpose,"" said Mr Smith.
""Everyone accepts that what the agencies do operationally has to be secret, but the laws that say what they can and can't do shouldn't be secret.""
An official policy about how such data collection should be carried out lawfully came into force in February 2015 - this was put into practice by the intelligence agencies later the same year.
It included guidance as to how collected data should be acquired, managed and destroyed
The tribunal found that, prior to this, personal datasets compiled by spy agencies did not comply with Article 8 and were therefore ""unlawful"".
""The powers available to the security and intelligence agencies play a vital role in protecting the UK and its citizens,"" said the Home Office in a statement.
""We are therefore pleased the tribunal has confirmed the current lawfulness of the existing bulk communications data and bulk personal dataset regimes.""
It added that the government was ""committed"" to providing greater transparency and stronger safeguards for bulk data collection powers available to intelligence agencies.","UK spy agencies broke privacy rules by collecting large amounts of UK citizens' data without adequate oversight, the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT) has ruled.",37680058
224,"The 20-year-old Frenchman joined Celtic from Fulham in the summer, with his 32-goal haul ensuring he is now one of Europe's most sought-after strikers.
And Rodgers insists Dembele has benefited massively from making the switch to Scotland's top-flight.
""He's developed very well and met the challenge to play for a big club, feel pressure and win trophies,"" he said.
""He wants to improve and that's the type of player you want to work with.""
Dembele cost Celtic a development fee of just £500,000 but his value has rocketed after a stunning debut season.
Rodgers concedes that the striker will leave the club one day but expects a lot more from him before that time comes.
""I think we all know at some point he will move on, it's just about timing,"" Rodgers told BBC Sport.
""But I know at this point he's very happy here. He's only 20 and he's been a joy to work with.
""There's no doubt there will be a natural point in time that he goes, I think we all understand that. Unfortunately, that's how it goes up here. But if he serves the club well in his time here that's all we can ask for.""

Celtic will win the Premiership title if they beat Hearts at Tynecastle on Sunday.
They are unbeaten in the league this season, have already won the League Cup and are in the semi-final of the Scottish Cup.
Rodgers described the club's unbeaten run as ""incredible"" but knows his side have a lot to do to go through the whole campaign without suffering a loss.
""I think the unbeaten one is very difficult,"" he said. ""We have nine games to go and the last five games you go into a split. The last five are against top six teams so it becomes really difficult.
""In terms of the treble, we never really mention it. We have to stabilise that emotion and just think about performing and playing well.
""We want to win every game we play. For the remainder of season we will push as hard as we have all season - I think the group is getting better as they play more together.""
