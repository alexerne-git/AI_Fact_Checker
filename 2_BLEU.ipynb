You feel good and feel ready, then you get the next kick.\\n\\\"The worst part is behind me now. I want to feel ready when I am fully back. I want to feel safe and confident. I don't mind if it is two weeks or six.\\\"\\nGundogan made 15 appearances and scored five goals in his debut season for City following his \\u00a320m move from Borussia Dortmund.\\nHe is eager to get on the field again and was impressed at the club's 4-1 win over Real Madrid in a pre-season game in Los Angeles on Wednesday.\\nManager Pep Guardiola has made five new signings already this summer and continues to have an interest in Arsenal forward Alexis Sanchez and Monaco's Kylian Mbappe.\\nGundogan said: \\\"Optimism for the season is big. It is huge, definitely.\\n\\\"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\\\"\\nCity complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.\\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.\\nSpurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.\\nAnd Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.\\nHe said: \\\"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.\\n\\\"They are really uncomfortable to play against.\\n\\\"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\\\"\",\n          \"A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.\\nAs they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.\\nOne of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Simone Favaro got the crucial try with the last move of the game, following earlier touchdowns by Chris Fusaro, Zander Fagerson and Junior Bulumakau.\\nRynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons.\\nGlasgow showed far superior strength in depth as they took control of a messy match in the second period.\\nHome coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee.\\nGlasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.\\nIt took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.\\nGlasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.\\nBut the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.\\nThe visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.\\nIt was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg.\\nDebutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try.\\nThe Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.\\nHowever, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.\\nDragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: \\\"We're disappointed to have lost but our performance was a lot better [than against Leinster] and the game could have gone either way.\\n\\\"Unfortunately too many errors behind the scrum cost us a great deal, though from where we were a fortnight ago in Dublin our workrate and desire was excellent.\\n\\\"It was simply error count from individuals behind the scrum that cost us field position, it's not rocket science - they were correct in how they played and we had a few errors, that was the difference.\\\"\\nGlasgow Warriors: Rory Hughes, Taqele Naiyaravoro, Alex Dunbar, Fraser Lyle, Lee Jones, Rory Clegg, Grayson Hart;

It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Patients and staff were evacuated from Cerahpasa hospital on Wednesday after a man receiving treatment at the clinic threatened to shoot himself and others.\\nOfficers were deployed to negotiate with the man, a young police officer.\\nEarlier reports that the armed man had taken several people hostage proved incorrect.\\nThe chief consultant of Cerahpasa hospital, Zekayi Kutlubay, who was evacuated from the facility, said that there had been \\\"no hostage crises\\\", adding that the man was \\\"alone in the room\\\".\\nDr Kutlubay said that the man had been receiving psychiatric treatment for the past two years.\\nHe said that the hospital had previously submitted a report stating that the man should not be permitted to carry a gun.\\n\\\"His firearm was taken away,\\\" Dr Kutlubay said, adding that the gun in the officer's possession on Wednesday was not his issued firearm.\\nThe incident comes amid tension in Istanbul following several attacks in crowded areas, including the deadly assault on the Reina nightclub on New Year's Eve which left 39 people dead.\",\n          \"Ferrari appeared in a position to challenge until the final laps, when the Mercedes stretched their legs to go half a second clear of the red cars.\\nSebastian Vettel will start third ahead of team-mate Kimi Raikkonen.\\nThe world champion subsequently escaped punishment for reversing in the pit lane, which could have seen him stripped of pole.\\nBut stewards only handed Hamilton a reprimand, after governing body the FIA said \\\"no clear instruction was given on where he should park\\\".\\nBelgian Stoffel Vandoorne out-qualified McLaren team-mate Jenson Button on his Formula 1 debut.\\nVandoorne was 12th and Button 14th, complaining of a handling imbalance on his final lap but admitting the newcomer \\\"did a good job and I didn't\\\".\\nMercedes were wary of Ferrari's pace before qualifying after Vettel and Raikkonen finished one-two in final practice, and their concerns appeared to be well founded as the red cars mixed it with the silver through most of qualifying.\\nAfter the first runs, Rosberg was ahead, with Vettel and Raikkonen splitting him from Hamilton, who made a mistake at the final corner on his first lap.\\nBut Hamilton saved his best for last, fastest in every sector of his final attempt, to beat Rosberg by just 0.077secs after the German had out-paced him throughout practice and in the first qualifying session.\\nVettel rued a mistake at the final corner on his last lap, but the truth is that with the gap at 0.517secs to Hamilton there was nothing he could have done.\\nThe gap suggests Mercedes are favourites for the race, even if Ferrari can be expected to push them.\\nVettel said: \\\"Last year we were very strong in the race and I think we are in good shape for tomorrow. We will try to give them a hard time.\\\"\\nVandoorne's preparations for his grand prix debut were far from ideal - he only found out he was racing on Thursday when FIA doctors declared Fernando Alonso unfit because of a broken rib sustained in his huge crash at the first race of the season in Australia two weeks ago.\\nThe Belgian rookie had to fly overnight from Japan, where he had been testing in the Super Formula car he races there, and arrived in Bahrain only hours before first practice on Friday.\\nHe also had a difficult final practice, missing all but the final quarter of the session because of a water leak.\\nButton was quicker in the first qualifying session, but Vandoorne pipped him by 0.064secs when it mattered.\\nThe 24-year-old said: \\\"I knew after yesterday I had quite similar pace to Jenson and I knew if I improved a little bit I could maybe challenge him and even out-qualify him and that is what has happened.\\n\\\"Jenson is a very good benchmark for me because he is a world champion and he is well known to the team so I am very satisfied with the qualifying.\\\"\\nButton, who was 0.5secs quicker than Vandoorne in the first session, complained of oversteer on his final run in the second: \\\"Q1 was what I was expecting. Q2 he did a good job and I didn't. Very, very good job. We knew how quick he was.\\\"\\nThe controversial new elimination qualifying system was retained for this race despite teams voting at the first race in Australia to go back to the 2015 system.\\nFIA president Jean Todt said earlier on Saturday that he \\\"felt it necessary to give new qualifying one more chance\\\", adding: \\\"We live in a world where there is too much over reaction.\\\"\\nThe system worked on the basis of mixing up the grid a little - Force India's Sergio Perez ended up out of position in 18th place after the team miscalculated the timing of his final run, leaving him not enough time to complete it before the elimination clock timed him out.\\nBut it will come in for more criticism as a result of lack of track action at the end of each session. There were three minutes at the end of the first session with no cars on the circuit, and the end of the second session was a similar damp squib.\\nOnly one car - Nico Hulkenberg's Force India - was out on the track with six minutes to go. The two Williams cars did go out in the final three minutes but were already through to Q3 and so nothing was at stake.\\nThe teams are meeting with Todt and F1 commercial boss Bernie Ecclestone on Sunday at noon local time to decide on what to do with qualifying for the rest of the season.\\nTodt said he was \\\"optimistic\\\" they would be able to reach unanimous agreement on a change.\\n\\\"We should listen to the people watching on TV,\\\" Rosberg said. \\\"If they are still unhappy, which I am sure they will be, we should change it.\\\"\\nRed Bull's Daniel Ricciardo was fifth on the grid, ahead of the Williams cars of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa and Force India's Nico Hulkenberg.\\nRicciardo's team-mate Daniil Kvyat was eliminated during the second session - way below the team's expectation - and the Renault of Brit Jolyon Palmer only managed 19th fastest.\\nGerman Mercedes protege Pascal Wehrlein managed an excellent 16th in the Manor car.\\nBahrain GP qualifying results\\nBahrain GP coverage details\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

It is huge, definitely.\\n\\\"We felt that last year as well but it was a completely new experience for all of us. We know the Premier League a bit more now and can't wait for the season to start.\\\"\\nCity complete their three-match tour of the United States against Tottenham in Nashville on Saturday.\\nChelsea manager Antonio Conte said earlier this week he did not feel Tottenham were judged by the same standards as his own side, City and Manchester United.\\nSpurs have had the advantage in their recent meetings with City, winning three and drawing one of their last four Premier League games.\\nAnd Gundogan thinks they are a major threat.\\nHe said: \\\"Tottenham are a great team. They have the style of football. They have young English players. Our experience last season shows it is really tough to beat them.\\n\\\"They are really uncomfortable to play against.\\n\\\"I am pretty sure, even if they will not say it loud, the people who know the Premier League know Tottenham are definitely a competitor for the title.\\\"\",\n          \"A fire alarm went off at the Holiday Inn in Hope Street at about 04:20 BST on Saturday and guests were asked to leave the hotel.\\nAs they gathered outside they saw the two buses, parked side-by-side in the car park, engulfed by flames.\\nOne of the tour groups is from Germany, the other from China and Taiwan. It was their first night in Northern Ireland.\\nThe driver of one of the buses said many of the passengers had left personal belongings on board and these had been destroyed.\\nBoth groups have organised replacement coaches and will begin their tour of the north coast later than they had planned.\\nPolice have appealed for information about the attack.\\nInsp David Gibson said: \\\"It appears as though the fire started under one of the buses before spreading to the second.\\n\\\"While the exact cause is still under investigation, it is thought that the fire was started deliberately.\\\"\",\n          \"Simone Favaro got the crucial try with the last move of the game, following earlier touchdowns by Chris Fusaro, Zander Fagerson and Junior Bulumakau.\\nRynard Landman and Ashton Hewitt got a try in either half for the Dragons.\\nGlasgow showed far superior strength in depth as they took control of a messy match in the second period.\\nHome coach Gregor Townsend gave a debut to powerhouse Fijian-born Wallaby wing Taqele Naiyaravoro, and centre Alex Dunbar returned from long-term injury, while the Dragons gave first starts of the season to wing Aled Brew and hooker Elliot Dee.\\nGlasgow lost hooker Pat McArthur to an early shoulder injury but took advantage of their first pressure when Rory Clegg slotted over a penalty on 12 minutes.\\nIt took 24 minutes for a disjointed game to produce a try as Sarel Pretorius sniped from close range and Landman forced his way over for Jason Tovey to convert - although it was the lock's last contribution as he departed with a chest injury shortly afterwards.\\nGlasgow struck back when Fusaro drove over from a rolling maul on 35 minutes for Clegg to convert.\\nBut the Dragons levelled at 10-10 before half-time when Naiyaravoro was yellow-carded for an aerial tackle on Brew and Tovey slotted the easy goal.\\nThe visitors could not make the most of their one-man advantage after the break as their error count cost them dearly.\\nIt was Glasgow's bench experience that showed when Mike Blair's break led to a short-range score from teenage prop Fagerson, converted by Clegg.\\nDebutant Favaro was the second home player to be sin-binned, on 63 minutes, but again the Warriors made light of it as replacement wing Bulumakau, a recruit from the Army, pounced to deftly hack through a bouncing ball for an opportunist try.\\nThe Dragons got back within striking range with some excellent combined handling putting Hewitt over unopposed after 72 minutes.\\nHowever, Favaro became sinner-turned-saint as he got on the end of another effective rolling maul to earn his side the extra point with the last move of the game, Clegg converting.\\nDragons director of rugby Lyn Jones said: \\\"We're disappointed to have lost but our performance was a lot better [than against Leinster] and the game could have gone either way.\\n\\\"Unfortunately too many errors behind the scrum cost us a great deal, though from where we were a fortnight ago in Dublin our workrate and desire was excellent.\\n\\\"It was simply error count from individuals behind the scrum that cost us field position, it's not rocket science - they were correct in how they played and we had a few errors, that was the difference.\\\"\\nGlasgow Warriors: Rory Hughes, Taqele Naiyaravoro, Alex Dunbar, Fraser Lyle, Lee Jones, Rory Clegg, Grayson Hart; Alex Allan, Pat MacArthur, Zander Fagerson, Rob Harley (capt), Scott Cummings, Hugh Blake, Chris Fusaro, Adam Ashe.\\nReplacements: Fergus Scott, Jerry Yanuyanutawa, Mike Cusack, Greg Peterson, Simone Favaro, Mike Blair, Gregor Hunter, Junior Bulumakau.\\nDragons: Carl Meyer, Ashton Hewitt, Ross Wardle, Adam Warren, Aled Brew, Jason Tovey, Sarel Pretorius; Boris Stankovich, Elliot Dee, Brok Harris, Nick Crosswell, Rynard Landman (capt), Lewis Evans, Nic Cudd, Ed Jackson.\\nReplacements: Rhys Buckley, Phil Price, Shaun Knight, Matthew Screech, Ollie Griffiths, Luc Jones, Charlie Davies, Nick Scott.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
