Where am I going to live? Have I got somewhere where I can see my daughter.\"\\n\"You\\'re put out among the same sort of people doing the same sort of thing, and it\\'s difficult, it\\'s difficult to get away from it. It\\'s like every man for himself, there\\'s nothing.\"\\nMarc has now found stable accommodation with homeless charity Emmaus and said it had been life changing.\\n\"You feel safe, you got hot food, you\\'ve got company of people in similar situations to yourself but all dealing with different issues. It\\'s a constructive, helpful atmosphere,\" he said.\\nTom Clarke, chief executive of Emmaus South Wales, agreed there was not enough support available.\\n\"We do still see [people] homeless on the streets, so clearly they haven\\'t got accommodation and haven\\'t got provision,\" he said.\\n\"I think the key is connecting people with the services they need. I don\\'t delude myself that Emmaus can offer a one size fits all for everyone, we can\\'t.\\n\"But there must be other opportunities and given suitable encouragement I believe that can and should happen.\"\\nA Welsh Government spokesman said the national pathway for homeless services to children, young people and adults in the secure estate had prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence.\\nIt added there were already significant demands for one-bedroom flats across the public and private sector and it was providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years.'\n",

        "# 5    'But there certainly should be.\\nThese are two of the biggest firms in the lucrative international business of making spectacles. France\\'s Essilor is the world\\'s number one manufacturer of lenses and contact lenses, while Italy\\'s Luxottica is the leading frame manufacturer.\\nIt is not obvious that the merger is in the public interest, though the two firms certainly think it is.\\n\"The parties\\' activities are highly complementary and the deal would generate significant synergies and innovation and would be beneficial to customers,\" says Essilor.\\nBut there seems to be growing disquiet in the industry.\\nGordon Ilett, of the Association of Optometrists, says: \"This now allows the [enlarged] group to control all aspects of supply of product - from manufacture to the end user.\\n\"Those businesses who remain as their customers will be indirectly controlled by the terms and conditions imposed by them.\\n\"Whether their UK market share, following this merger, is sufficient for examination by the competition authorities is open to debate, but the effect of it will be reduced choice for the consumer, and will most likely result in reduced quality products longer term,\" Mr Ilett adds.\\nIf the deal goes through later this year the new company, to be called EssilorLuxottica, will become a behemoth of the industry.\\nIt will sell not only lenses and frames around the world but will also be stocking its own optician\\'s shops as well, such as Sunglass Hut, and LensCrafters in the US and Australia, both currently owned by Luxottica.\\nOne long-standing independent UK wholesaler, who asked to remain anonymous, says the merged firm would be so powerful it would probably squeeze out some competitors.\\n\"If those two companies merged there would be a branded frame supplier offering you high-end branded frames, and also offering UK opticians a lens and glazing deal, to suit, so they will control almost everything [they offer] to both independent retailers in the High Street and even the chains,\" he argues.\\nIn his view this would amount, almost, to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up.\\n\"I imagine it would knock out quite a few glazing houses in the UK, and it would probably knock out other fashion frame houses,\" he adds.\\nUnless you know about the eyewear business, or take an interest in investing in big European companies (they both have stock market listings) the names of the two big firms will probably have passed you by.\\nBut if you have been inside an optician\\'s shop you will certainly have heard of the brands they own and make. For instance, the leading varifocal lens brand, Varilux, is made by Essilor.\\nJust a year ago, in presenting its 2015 financial results to investors, Essilor boasted that it was \"an undisputed leader with only 25% market share\" of the combined world market for prescription lenses, sunglasses lenses and lenses for reading glasses.\\nWhen it comes to just the prescription lenses, it has a 41% share of the world market.\\nFor its part, Luxottica owns several of its own brand names such as Ray-Ban and Oakley, and it also makes, under licence, spectacle frames which carry high-fashion names such as Armani, Burberry, Bulgari, Chanel, Prada, Ralph Lauren and Versace.\\nIn 2015 the Italian firm made almost 10% of the 954 million frames that were sold worldwide that year, and claims that about half a billion of its frames are currently perched on people\\'s noses.\\nThe overall industry internationally is in fact quite fragmented with hundreds of other smaller manufacturers and related businesses such as glazing laboratories.\\nMarket research firm GFK describes the optical industry as \"a complex and extremely competitive market-space\".\\nEven so, with the two firms having a combined turnover of more than 15bn euros (Â£12.8bn), of which 3.5bn euros were in Europe, on the grounds of size alone the proposed merger easily meets the requirements of the European Commission for a formal review.\\nThese are:\\nAn inquiry would see if the merged firm threatened to be too dominant, thus reducing competition and leading to higher prices for the customers.\\nA Luxottica spokesman told the BBC that the firm was confident that any scrutiny would not hinder the deal.\\n\"The transaction is subject to mandatory submission to a number of anti-monopoly authorities including the European one, as is customary in transactions of this size and nature,\" he said.\\n\"We are confident that the transaction does not raise anti-monopoly issues and will fully co-operate with the anti-monopoly authorities to obtain the required clearance,\" he added.\\nThe EU itself says it currently has no comment to make and it has not yet been formally notified of the merger deal under the requirements of its own rules.\\nBut the leading chain of opticians, Specsavers, views the impending deal with caution.\\n\"Mergers are a continuing trend in optics, but this is a significant development which will result in huge supply chain and retail implications for the industry and consumers worldwide,\" the firm says.\\n\"It is unlikely that the impact of the merger will be felt by consumers straight away but we will watch with great interest how the new organisation will arrange itself.\"\\nIf you have ever bought a pair of spectacles with anything other than the most basic frame and lenses, you may have gulped at the price, possibly coming to several hundred pounds.\\nOf course, not all spectacles are expensive and not all of the sale price goes to the manufacturers.\\nOpticians and the wholesalers that supply them are businesses that seek to make a profit.\\nThey also need to cover the costs of staff, equipment, shop and office space, stock and all that advertising.\\nBut for the manufacturers such as Essilor and Luxottica, it is a stonkingly profitable business.\\nOn worldwide sales of 6.7bn euros in 2015, Essilor made operating profits of 1.2bn euros.\\nFor the same year, Luxottica sold goods worth 8.8bn euros and made operating profits of 1.4bn euros.\\nWith cost-cutting at a merged business projected to save between 400m and 600m euros per year, profits could be boosted even further.\\nWill customers benefit as well?'\n",

I don\\'t think the fastest team on the day were permitted to race.\\n\"There are certain chosen riders on the team who will not have experienced the culture of fear and will not have been on the receiving end of that - the bullying, the harassment, being frozen out of opportunities.\\n\"It was horrid - it was not the training environment I expected. There was no choice. If you rocked the boat, you were out. There was no alternative.\\n\"Medals at any cost, that\\'s how it was whenever I was there, certainly in 2012.\"\\nHouvenaghel said she also witnessed the sexism that has been highlighted by other female riders, and also claims she was discriminated against because of her age.\\n\"I can certainly relate to the bullying,\" she said. \"For me personally, I felt it was more ageism - being a little bit older than my team-mates, it didn\\'t seem to be something that the staff necessarily wanted for our team in 2012.\\n\"They didn\\'t care about what happened to me afterwards. I never heard another thing from them.\\n\"After six years of constantly medalling at World Cups, World Championships, nationals, both on the track and on the road, they discarded me in a very undignified way from the team, which I don\\'t feel was right.\"\\nFourteen-time Paralympic gold medallist Dame Sarah Storey told BBC Sport that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.\\nAsked about the balance between winning and athlete welfare, the 39-year-old replied: \"It\\'s a really difficult question because you have to be a human being, you have to allow for people to make mistakes. But the currency is race wins, the currency is gold medals.\\n\"It\\'s not an excuse but you have to have a thick skin in sport, you have to be able to take the rough with the smooth because of the racing that you go through.\\n\"But there are no excuses for crossing that line, and if those lines have been crossed they will be found out and they\\'ll be dealt with.\"'\n",

But Kareem Badr says people did laugh in 2009 when he and two friends paid $20,000 (Â£13,000) for the Hideout in Austin, when it wasn\\'t making money and the previous owner decided not to renew the lease.\\n\"We took over a sinking ship and each brought a bucket to bail it out,\" says Mr Badr.\\n\"None of us had any experience of running a business. But we loved what we were doing enough that it carried us through.\"\\nThree years ago he was able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.\\nMr Badr says it\\'s still not as much as he used to make as a programmer (about $80,000 a year), but he now employs around 25 part time and contract workers.\\nAnd he recently expanded the premises, taking over the adjoining coffee house which sells alcohol, and leasing more theatre space.\\nMr Badr says: \"I think my background in computer science helped because I can take a big problem, break it up into small chunks, and figure out how to make it better and more efficient.\\n\"That\\'s basically what we did for every aspect of the business. And by doing that it naturally started to improve.\"\\nMr Badr may have been helped by national trends, which imply a growing enthusiasm for comedy clubs in the US.\\nAn industry report from data firm Ibis World expects total US annual comedy club revenue to grow by 1.8% over the next five years to $344.6m in 2020.\\n\"When the Hideout first opened it was the only improv theatre in Austin,\" says Mr Badr.\\n\"But now there are five [comedy] schools and four theatres. We were at the right place at the right time.\"\\nWhile the Ibis World report showed that dozens of US comedy clubs were forced to close in the wake of the 2008 recession, when fewer people had disposable income to spend on live entertainment, Stephen Rosenfield, director of the American Comedy Institute in New York, says stand-up comedy is now entering a new golden age.\\n\"The US has comedy clubs all over the country, not just in big cities, and they require talent,\" he says.\\n\"In any field there are those at the top who make dynastic fortunes. But because of the significance of the local comedy club, there is a career and a living to be made by good comedians who are not superstars.\"\\nMr Rosenfield says the growing popularity of stand-up comedy is fuelled in part by younger audiences, who view humorous TV hosts such as Jon Stewart, Jay Leno and Steve Colbert as their primary source for news.\\n\"It\\'s not just entertaining them, it\\'s also informing them,\" he says. \"There\\'s a new immediacy to stand-up that makes it much more appealing to a generation that\\'s on social media, tweeting, face booking and blogging.\"\\nBut clubs don\\'t only make money from entertainers. Alcohol alone can bring in as much as 40% of the night\\'s takings, and many clubs demand that audiences buy a minimum number of drinks per person.\\n\"A club really has three businesses going on,\" says Mr Rosenfield.\\n\"It\\'s an entertainment entity, a restaurant and a bar. They make money from selling drinks and dinners, and they make money from the cover charge.\\n\"There are usually three people on the bill. The opening act is the new comedian. They do about 20 minutes and introduce the other comics.\\nThe middle act does about half an hour, and then there\\'s the headliner. They almost always have TV credits, and are the ones people are coming to see. That headliner could be making six figures a year.\"\\nTop-tier performers make much more. According to Forbes, Canadian comedian Russell Peters grossed $19m with 64 shows in 2013, while industry veteran Jerry Seinfeld is the highest paid comedian in the US, set to earn $36m this year.\\nSteve Byrne, 41, is a veteran stand-up comedian based in LA, and star of his own television show Sullivan and Son, which ran for three seasons.\\nHe describes himself as a successful mid-level comedian who makes an annual six figure salary mainly from touring.\\nAnd although he was close to hitting a million dollars a year before his show was cancelled in 2014, he says most comedians make money at clubs and do television to boost their brand rather than their income.\\nMr Bryne says: \"Gigs vary because it depends what you\\'re contracted at.\\n\"If it\\'s somebody starting off in the business it could be $1,500 a show. For somebody who\\'s had some TV credits you could go from $4,500 to $7,500.\\n\"And if you\\'re just a knock out comic, then you\\'re coming in and getting a door deal. You\\'re taking all the tickets, and the club gets the concessions.\"\\nMr Byrne says hard work is the key to success. There is no magic short cut, and few lucky breaks.\\n\"The one single thing that an aspiring comedian should do is write, write, write. What is it that makes you laugh?\\n\"Your voice should resonate with your audience. So find your voice and you will find your audience.\"\\nWhile the music and film industries have been impacted by the internet, such as illegal downloads and reduced album sales, Mr Rosenfield says the online world has actually given live comedy a boost.\\n\"The format of comedy, particularly stand-up, lends itself to digital media like nothing else. One terrific joke can get a million hits,\" he says.\\n\"It\\'s become a new metric for a club manager. If a booker sees that a comic has 500,000 online followers - they\\'ll book him almost sight unseen. That\\'s it.\\n\"Digital is gigantically important and has been for a while.\"\\nBut in the end, the success of comedy comes down to a very simple fact - people need to laugh.\\nBack in 2001 Steve Byrne was a comedian in New York when terrorists flew two planes into the World Trade Centre on 11 September.\\nHe says: \"We all thought \\'who\\'s going to come to a comedy club? The dream\\'s over, I\\'ve got to get a real job now\\'.\\n\"But after a week, I forget which club was the first one to open its doors, but it was packed. People needed an outlet.\\n\"And I remember for months on end those clubs in New York City were just jam packed. That was the thing that told me that this was a profession that is foolproof.\"'\n",

BT\\'s retirement scheme, inherited from its time as a state-owned utility, has assets of about Â£40bn and a deficit, on some measures, of about Â£10bn, even though BT has poured in billions of pounds in recent years to redress the gap.\\nSenior sources at the company say that about 80% of the scheme relates to Openreach, the internet infrastructure provider that BT\\'s rivals would like to see spun off.\\nSeparating the pension as part of a break-up would be a costly headache - and there is the small matter of a government guarantee on part of the scheme, something that BT fought in the courts to preserve and won.\\nCreating two new pension schemes, with the risk of weakening the financial resources of one or the other, might be too hot a political potato, even in the pursuit of faster broadband.\\nBT\\'s share price reaction might turn out to be overdone. Ms White plans to enforce the separation by introducing not only a new board to run Openreach, but also new articles of association that will give directors a duty to serve customers of the network as much as the company\\'s owners.\\nThis holds out an obvious prospect of conflicts to come, and runs counter to the normal assumption that in private companies, the shareholder is king.\\nIt also carries an echo of the \"golden shares\" held by the government in Rolls-Royce and BAE Systems, two companies judged important for the defence of the realm. In each case, the golden share is actually enshrined by specific articles of association that give directors and the government powers beyond those normally enjoyed by company boards.\\nBT\\'s chief executive, Gavin Patterson, said he thought he could reach a compromise with Ofcom, but admitted they would need to see the detail of the new articles.\\nIf they prove too much at odds with BT\\'s own desire to control Openreach - which it will still own - get ready for a court battle and perhaps, eventually, a full break-up.'\n",
